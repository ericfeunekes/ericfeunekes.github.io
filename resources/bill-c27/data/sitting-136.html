        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11953142">Mr. Richard Cannings (South Okanagan‚ÄîWest Kootenay, NDP) </a></b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; moved that Bill <a id="11474572" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11474572">S-222, An Act to amend the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act (use of wood)</a>, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461902"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said: Mr. Speaker, I am happy and proud to rise in the House this morning to begin debate on a bill from the other place, Bill <a id="11474572" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11474572">S-222</a>. This is a small but mighty bill that would create beautiful, safe federal buildings, support our forestry sector during difficult times, spur innovation in the cement and steel industries and help us reach our climate targets.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461903"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would this bill do? It simply states that when building federal infrastructure, the Minister of Public Works ‚Äúshall consider any potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and any other environmental benefits and may allow the use of wood or any other thing ‚Äî including a material, product or sustainable resource ‚Äî that achieves such benefits.‚Äù</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461904"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned the bill came from the Senate, but, in fact, this bill started its life in the House of Commons, first as a Bloc bill more than a decade ago. I took up the bill in the 42nd Parliament where, as Bill <a id="8867011" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/8867011">C-354</a>, it passed in the House of Commons, but died in the Senate when that Parliament ended. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461905"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take a moment to thank my friend, Senator Diane Griffin. Senator Griffin guided the bill through the Senate in 2018 and 2019 and when the bill stalled there, through no fault of her own, she reintroduced the bill in the 43rd Parliament. As many here remember, that Parliament ended prematurely due to an election, so Senator Griffin introduced it once again last year in this Parliament. It is through her persistence that we are seeing it again.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461906"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senator Griffin retired last spring, so she passed the torch to Senator Jim Quinn, who saw it through its passage in the Senate earlier this fall.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461907"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The initial form of the bill over a decade ago was a direct ask of the minister to consider wood in the construction of federal infrastructure. It was modelled on the Charte du bois in Quebec and the wood-first bill in British Columbia. It was designed then to ensure that the federal government actually considered wood when building large infrastructure. Until recently, the construction industry had been totally geared to cement and steel when doing that.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461908"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My version of the bill was amended in committee to remove the overt preference for wood and replace that with preference for materials that had environmental benefits, in particular regarding the greenhouse gas footprints of the building materials. This amendment allayed a couple of concerns around the trade implications of potentially favouring one sector over another and also recognized the emerging work on making concrete and steel more environmentally friendly. I will speak more on that later. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461909"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was initially inspired to take up this bill in 2016 because of a company in my riding, in my home town of Penticton. That company is Structurlam, and it has been at the leading edge of mass timber engineered wood construction in North America.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461910"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Structurlam leads that sector, it still faces some of the hurdles that confront all innovative companies. It needs help to scale-up its production, and the easiest way for a government to help a company in that situation is to provide business through government procurement. That is one of the core benefits of this bill. It would help Canadian companies scale-up to maintain our dominant position in the engineered wood sector in North America. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461911"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forest products, with their sequestered carbon, are obvious candidates for decisions under this policy. If we can use more wood in government infrastructure and grow the mass timber market in Canada, it will obviously benefit the forest sector overall.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461912"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are benefits to a forest industry beset by challenges on all sides. Beetle infestations, catastrophic wildfires and a long history of harvests have all reduced access to fibre. To top it off, the softwood lumber dispute has brought illegal tariffs from our biggest trading partner, the United States. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461913"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reduced fibre access means we have to get more jobs and more money for every log we cut, and that is what mass timber provides.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461914"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To make glulam beams or cross-laminated timber panels, mass timber plants use lumber sourced from local mills. That gives those mills a new domestic market for their products and it reduces their reliance on the United States. On top of that, we can sell those mass timber products to the United States tariff-free, so it is a win-win.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461915"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just to reiterate, the bill and a rejuvenated domestic market for lumber would not mean increased forest harvest, as that is limited by other factors, but it will mean getting more value added out of the trees we do cut. There are benefits to using mass timber, benefits for the construction industry and benefits for the users of that infrastructure.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1105"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1105"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1110"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1110"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1100"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1100" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1105)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461916"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I will mention the construction process itself. Engineered wood is produced indoors in plant facilities. The building can be literally constructed indoors with no weather delays or complications, while the site is being prepared for construction. Then the building components can be put together quickly and delivered to the site exactly when needed.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461917"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brock Commons, an 18-storey residence complex at the University of British Columbia, the tallest wood building in the world, was built in 57 days, two storeys per week. It is now home to over 400 UBC students. Because the component parts are built indoors, they can be constructed to very fine tolerances, within millimetres, and that means a lot when one is constructing the buildings of the future that will have to be built to passive energy specifications.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461918"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The buildings constructed in this way are beautiful. The exposed wood components are like furniture. Structurlam has an entire finishing plant devoted to smoothing and treating every exposed beam and wall panel as if it were a piece of massive furniture.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461919"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not surprising many of the early examples of mass timber construction were civic buildings meant to look good as well as be functional, buildings such as the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the Olympic speed skating oval in Richmond, B.C. and the Rocky Ridge recreation centre in Calgary. The Rocky Ridge facility has over 2,000 glulam beams forming its huge roof, and no two are the same. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461920"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to also mention that Canada leads the way in engineered wood construction in North America. Structurlam has projects all across the continent and has recently opened up a branch plant in Arkansas. Nordic Structures in Chibougamau, Quebec was another pioneer of this technology.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461921"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another major mass timber plant has recently opened in my riding just outside Castlegar. It was opened up by Kalesnikoff Lumber. I would like to give a shout-out to Ken Kalesnikoff and his son Chris and daughter Krystle for making this major investment that will pay off for the future of the West Kootenay and the forest sector in British Columbia. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461922"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One issue that often comes up when talking about tall wood buildings is fire safety. I hear from firefighters who just simply do not like the concept of wood buildings of any size. We heard testimony of that nature in both House of Commons and Senate committees. However, I need to reiterate that large infrastructure projects under this legislation would be constructed with mass timber. Firefighters I talked to are concerned about buildings constructed with traditional wood frame construction such as two-by-fours and two-by-sixes.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461923"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mass timber is another thing entirely. When we have glulam beams a metre thick or cross laminated timber panels nine inches thick, those materials react to open flame in a completely different way.

Those concerns were largely met by the amendments that were made in the committee in the 42nd Parliament and carried through to this version of the bill. I just talked to the cement industry last week, and it is supportive.

    <p class="floorlanguage">[<i>English</i>]</p><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461957"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By prioritizing green procurement, PSPC can help protect the environment in several different ways. Beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions from government operations, green procurement will also have the same effect on our supply chains. Moreover, it cuts down on the use of hazardous and toxic substances, pollution and plastic waste. It also supports the Canadian economy by creating new markets for innovative products and services. In this context, green procurement includes assessing the life cycles of goods that are purchased, and adopting clean technologies and green products and services. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461958"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government‚Äôs policy on green procurement also stipulates the criteria for sustainable goods and services to guide procurement operations. These criteria require potential suppliers to demonstrate that their products can reduce emissions, are sustainable or have other environmental benefits.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461959"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that it purchases nearly $24 billion on behalf of the majority of departments and agencies, PSPC has substantial leverage to create markets for sustainable goods. This can act like a virtuous circle and inspire other manufacturers and businesses to up their game and offer greener alternatives to the greater consumer market, which will benefit all of us.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461960"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greening government strategy also commits the government to maintaining a plan to reach net zero for its real property portfolio by 2050. That plan also has to show that its buildings and infrastructure are resilient to climate change and cost-effective. For example, PSPC is transforming the iconic Centre Block from one of the highest-emitting PSPC assets to a near net-zero carbon facility. It is also using low-carbon construction materials where possible in the new Parliament Welcome Centre. In addition, during the rehabilitation of West Block‚Äî</div></span></div>

He bought a chainsaw and proceeded to make a fortune cutting down trees in northern British Columbia. That was a lifelong passion of his. He was very much an admirer of Canadian forests and Canadian trees.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461978"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having bought a chainsaw, that was his means to earn a living here in Canada, and it was a good living. He noted that by 1956, he bought a brand new Chevrolet pickup for $1,600, and that in one particular month he made $2,200. He made more money in one month than it cost to buy a brand new pickup. In today's dollars, that is probably $40,000 or $50,000 in one month, which is incredible.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461979"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The forestry industry across Canada is one of the reasons Canada exists. There were many interests coming across the ocean early on, starting in about year 1,000. There was the fishing industry that came across the ocean, with people fishing off the Grand Banks, but also the lumber industry. When folks came from Europe to Canada for the first time, they noted the large trees, and for shipbuilding they used the trees here. One of the reasons that people came to Canada was to develop our forest industry and use the giant trees we have here to build things. That is definitely part of our heritage and part of the reason that Canada exists, and it is good to recognize that.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461980"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If members are ever in Calgary, they should check out the ATCO Commercial Centre. It is a big new building in the middle of Calgary. I had the opportunity to speak at an anti-human trafficking event that was hosted there just a couple of weeks ago, and I was impressed and blown away by the grandeur of the building and all of the beam work inside of it. I bet the ceiling is nearly 100 feet tall. It is as tall as the ceiling in here or maybe taller, and whereas here we see the beams are made out of steels, there they are made out of wood. It is an impressive structure and is really neat to see, and it is something we can enjoy as a Canadian society.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461981"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will get back to my grandfather coming across the ocean to become a logger in northern British Columbia. While this bill is very much supportive of the forestry industry and the lumber industry, the challenge we have today is that many people are fighting against the harvesting of our forests. Most of those in the forestry industry whom I deal with in my area have a 100-year plan on how they are going to harvest the trees. They harvest some trees in one area, move to another area and harvest some trees and then move to another area. Within 100 years, they anticipate harvesting about 70% of all trees on the landscape, but by the time they are done that, they can go back to where they started and start harvesting the trees all over again. In the area where I live, the average tree is probably 40 or 50 years old before the wind blows it over, it dies or a forest fire comes along and takes care of it, so a 100-year plan on harvesting the forest is a good idea.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1130"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1130"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1135"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1135"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1125"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1125" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1130)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461982"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge amount of value that lives in the forest, but there is an increasing number of voices in this country of people who want to shut down the forestry industry and want to shut down logging. For full disclosure, I have many family members who work in the forestry industry. My brother works in the forestry industry building roads and working on a processor. My brother-in-law is a heavy-duty mechanic who works on forestry equipment, so it is a big part of my family's life. Increasingly, they are frustrated with the inability of the government to get organized around managing and developing the industry.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461983"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a good bill, in that it recognizes the potential and the benefits of the forestry industry. Particularly, I would note that in British Columbia there is more and more difficulty in getting access to the wood fibre. In Alberta, it is not a great deal better. The rest of the country I am not as familiar with, so I cannot say. However, it is an increasing challenge all the time to get access to the wood fibre. While Bill <a id="11474572" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11474572">S-222</a> would indicate we should be using wood to build buildings, if we are unable to harvest the trees in the forest in order to make the lumber, this bill would not necessarily go places.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461984"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ensure that this is a country that can build things again, that can develop its natural resources and that lives up to the heritage it was given by the first peoples who developed our forestry industry. Wood has been used to build dwellings and buildings forever. There are wood structures around the world that are over 1,000 years old. It is a good building product, but we need to ensure that we can develop this resource across the country.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461985"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would note that there are voices across this country that are working very hard to minimize and to stop the development of our forestry industry. Particularly, British Columbia is where I note this to be a challenge, and I hope we can see governments coming around to promoting this. I would note that the New Democrats have been a government in power in British Columbia for a long time, and were historically very much champions of development of the forestry industry. However, today it seems to be a challenge to develop the forestry industry.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461986"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing a reduction in allowable cuts. We are seeing a reduction in the land that is available for managing it. It is ironic, to some degree, that most of British Columbia is covered by forests. It is one of the areas where forestry is probably the most valuable resource they have. The northern half of Alberta is covered with forests, and forestry is a big deal up there as well, but I note that it is definitely something we have to be concerned about.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461987"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, we have had a few discussions with folks around fire concerns and wood buildings. It is an interesting discussion to have regarding fire ratings. Let us think about it a little and get back to that ATCO building in Calgary. The same building could be built with steel girders.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461988"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typically, steel girders are an I-beam configuration. What is really fascinating about a steel girder in an I-beam configuration versus a wooden glulam beam, which is made from multiple laminated pieces of wood, is that the wood actually has a much better fire rating.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461989"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is interesting, because we think that fire would consume the wood. The wood is consumed in a fire, but it actually maintains its structural integrity for a very long time, even if it is burning. However, a steel beam, because of the two layers, will actually twist and buckle if one side of it is heated. We had a bridge in Edmonton that buckled just because of the heat of the sunshine, so it is interesting to think about some of these things.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461990"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am looking forward to supporting this bill. I hope this country can get back to developing our natural resources and harvesting the trees.</div></span></div>

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11953796">Mr. Mario Simard (Jonqui√®re, BQ)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak about Bill <a id="11474572" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11474572">S¬≠222</a>.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461992"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we want to trace the origins of the discussions that led to an act that would benefit forest products, we need to go back to the proposals of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. As early as March 2010, Bill <a id="4328349" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/4328349">C‚Äë429</a>, which dealt with something very similar and was sponsored by the member for Manicouagan at the time, was being studied. The same thing happened a few years later, in 2014. The member for my former riding, Jonqui√®re-Alma, which is now called Jonqui√®re, had also tabled a similar bill. What we realized then was that the House's interest in supporting the forestry sector was not very high.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461993"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would remind the House that, at the time, in 2010, the NDP voted in favour of the bill. However, in 2014, they changed their stance a bit. Half of their caucus was against the bill because it might be detrimental to the steel beam industry. I say that because I feel that there has never been the appropriate balance of power to bring the interests of the forestry industry to the House. It is no coincidence that the province where the forestry industry is largest is Quebec. Unfortunately, here, the Conservatives, among others, have never voted in favour of such measures.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461994"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill S‚Äë222 certainly has potential, but there is no denying that it will need to be amended if it is referred to committee. The major difference in Bill S‚Äë222 is that it is devoid of any means of enforcement. The bill feels like wishful thinking: It simply hopes that more wood will be used. However, if we are to achieve this, there must be some means of enforcement. This is the case with the Quebec law.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461995"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, the wood charter assumes that, for all buildings under six storeys, a wood solution must be considered. It is mandatory. Perhaps it is something that can be corrected in the bill. We may be able to do that work in committee, but it would be essential. The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois will support this bill, but I believe that it should go a little further and make consideration of wood for federal government infrastructure mandatory.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461996"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will take this opportunity to address another aspect. As I said at the beginning of my speech, I find that the forestry sector tends to be overlooked when it comes to federal government support. I would like to demonstrate that. As I have repeated around 3,000 times in the House, Canada has an economy that is based on two major industries: the oil and gas sector and the automobile sector. Support for the forestry sector has consistently been anemic.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461997"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will share some figures from a study that I commissioned along with every other member of the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois. The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois is a caucus that is focused on the issue of softwood lumber. I will share the figures from the nine key federal programs that help the forestry sector.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461998"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From 2017 to 2020, we can say that roughly $317¬†million was redirected to the forestry sector. Keep in mind that 75% of the money that was distributed throughout Canada was in the form of guaranteed loans and 25% of that money was in the form of real subsidies. Earlier, the comparison was made with the oil and gas sector, but I think that is a bit of a stretch. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7461999"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec represents 22.5% of the federation, but the volume of Quebec's forestry sector represents a bit more than 30% of the sector Canada-wide. Canada pays Quebec $71¬†million a year. If we apply that same calculation, that means that 75% of that amount is in the form of loans. Quebec is therefore paid $53.5¬†million a year in the form of loans and $17¬†billion is paid in the form of subsidies. My region of Quebec, Saguenay‚ÄëLac‚ÄëSaint‚ÄëJean, provides more to the federal government than the entirety of the subsidies that are offered to Quebec's forestry sector. The $71¬†million paid by the federal government to the forestry industry does not even represent 0.3% of the sector's $20¬†billion in annual sales.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1140"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1140"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1145"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1145"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1135"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1135" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1140)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462000"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I checked and found that the federal government provides the least amount of support to these sectors. I see the disparity when I examine the fossil fuel sector. I say that because, on my initiative, the Standing Committee on Natural Resources is doing a comparative study of all the different natural resources sectors.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462001"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I look at the fossil fuel sector, the cost of the Trans Mountain pipeline alone is $21¬†billion. Then, there are the $18¬†billion a year over 2020-22. Canada Economic Development, or CED, will be providing $5.4¬†billion, which will be redirected only to the oil and gas sector. That does not include $2.5¬†billion in the last budget for carbon capture strategies. As I am not meanspirited, I am not going to talk about everything to do with the cleanup of orphan wells and lines of credit that we have seen since 2019. I just want to say that it is appalling.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462002"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There really is a double standard. I do not see why this legislation would not pass. It would not cost the federal government very much to consider promoting the use of lumber in its contracts. It is simply a regulatory measure that does not necessarily involve funding.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462003"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the federal government is allergic to supporting the forestry industry. If a small sawmill asks for help from CED, it will not get it. Instead, the sawmill will be immediately referred to Global Affairs Canada. No small sawmill in Quebec or Canada can get support from the economic arm of the federal government alone for fear of violating American softwood lumber laws. That is a big problem. It means that companies that do not even do business with the United States are not entitled to support from CED. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462004"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to quickly come back to what the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois has been doing to support the forestry industry. In September¬†2020, we presented a green recovery plan to get out of the COVID‚Äë19 pandemic. One of the main focuses of this recovery plan is the development of natural resources, including the forestry sector.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462005"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October¬†2020, on my initiative, the Standing Committee on Natural Resources was studying the renewal of the forestry sector. There were some very interesting proposals, one being that the federal government start using the concept of carbon footprint in its tenders.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462006"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this could be worked into Bill¬†<a id="11474572" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11474572">S‚Äë222</a>. It goes much further than just using wood in construction. If we go with the idea of a carbon footprint, then all derivatives from the bioeconomy‚Äîthat is, products derived from the forest biomass‚Äîwould qualify. Think of packaging products, for one. We can replace single-use plastics right now. It would provide a much broader scope for supporting the forestry sector, and we could reduce our carbon footprint.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462007"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, even though these recommendations were made in a committee study, the government never acted on them. In fact, last week we had people from the forestry sector come before us. They came to tell us that the time for committee studies has passed, and we must now take action. We are still waiting for that action.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462008"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2021, the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois hosted a forum on forests and climate change. Participants included experts from academia and the forestry sector, producers and people involved in research and development. At the end of the forum, participants reached a unanimous conclusion. From an economic perspective, our best weapon in the battle against climate change is the forestry sector. Forests are carbon sinks. The more carbon we sequester by building with wood, the better our GHG performance.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462009"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently toured Chantiers Chibougamau with my party leader. I would actually encourage all members to go see what is happening at Chantiers Chibougamau. They are superstars. They use pulpwood, the little bits from treetops, to make glued-laminated I-joists of astounding size.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1145"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1145"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1150"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1150"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1140"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1140" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1145)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11953952">Mr. Taylor Bachrach (Skeena‚ÄîBulkley Valley, NDP)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, like a lot of my colleagues in this place, I spend a lot of time in airports. Yesterday afternoon I had a chance to spend a few minutes in my home airport, the Smithers Regional Airport. I was sitting in the departure lounge watching the sun set behind Hudson Bay Mountain and looking around the room, marvelling at what a beautiful space the community has created there. I know there are not many airports one could describe as beautiful, but it is certainly one of them.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462012"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has personal significance for me because, during my time in local government as the mayor of Smithers, we undertook a major renovation of the Smithers Regional Airport. It was a building dating back to the 1950s and was in much need of renovation and renewal. Part of that was a brand new departure lounge. In undertaking this major project, with help from the provincial and federal governments, we had a number of objectives. We obviously wanted to make it a functional, modern space, but we also wanted to use it as an opportunity to tackle our community's greenhouse gas emissions and take responsibility for our role in this huge challenge we face.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462013"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did that in a number of ways. We installed a geoexchange system for heating and cooling the building, which takes energy out of the ground and does so mostly without the use of fossil fuels. The other area where we really tried to drive sustainability was the use of wood.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462014"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know there has been a lot of discussion about some of the more technical aspects, but what I was struck by yesterday, sitting in this room looking at the beautiful glulam beams and expanses of cross-laminated timber, is just the beauty of wood as a building product. In addition to all its other benefits, it is truly a spectacular product to be building with. This is important not only because the forest industry is a big part of our economy and always has been in British Columbia, but also, in the context of this bill, because wood is a lower-carbon building material than many other options.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462015"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to rise and speak to Bill <a id="11474572" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11474572">S-222</a>. I believe this bill originally was intended to promote the use of wood in the construction of public infrastructure in Canada. I want to take a moment to recognize Senator Griffin, the bill's sponsor in the other place, but mostly my colleague, the brilliant MP for <a id="278628" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/278628/2022-11-28">South Okanagan‚ÄîWest Kootenay</a>, who has been a tireless champion for the role wood can play in addressing climate change.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462016"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill calls for amending the Department of Public Works and Government Services Act by adding the following wording to the clause laying out the minister‚Äôs powers and responsibilities:</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462017"></a><div>
        <div>
          <div valign="top">
            <div width="15" align="right"></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>In developing requirements with respect to the construction, maintenance and repair of public works, federal real property and federal immovables, the Minister shall consider any potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and any other environmental benefits and may allow the use of wood or any other thing‚Äîincluding a material, product or sustainable resource‚Äîthat achieves such benefits.</small></div>
</div>
</div>
</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462018"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand that was amended to recognize some of the improvements in the steel industry and in the manufacturing of concrete, etc.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462019"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope colleagues will forgive me if my comments about this bill speak directly to the benefits of wood as a building product. This is a topic that has personal significance for me. My father worked for over 30 years in the forest industry. He was a buckerman, which, for folks who are less familiar with forestry, is the person who works in the bush and cuts the logs to length before they are loaded onto the trucks headed for the mill. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462020"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember how frustrated my dad was by some of the waste that occurred in the forest industry at the time. There were trees and logs that were too big to be used by the sawmills and were left in the bush and eventually burned. I remember his chainsaw mill, a little portable mill that attached to his chainsaw. He would take it out on the weekends and mill these logs into slabs, bring them home and build beautiful things from them. He was also the person who instilled in me a love for forests and a recognition of the need to do forestry responsibly and sustainably, an area I believe we continue to make progress in today. Of course, he built many beautiful things out of wood.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462021"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I speak to this bill today, I am thinking of my dad and those values he instilled in me.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1150"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1150"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1155"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1155"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1145"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1145" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1150)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462022"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <a id="11474572" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11474572">S-222</a> speaks to public procurement as an opportunity for addressing greenhouse gas emissions through the choice of building materials, and this is indeed a huge opportunity. Much of the debate around tackling climate change has focused on emissions from the operation of buildings and transportation and such. However, the embodied carbon in building materials represents a significant challenge and opportunity when it comes to tackling the climate crisis. Given the billions of dollars spent on public procurement every year, and my colleague across the way mentioned the figure of, I believe, $27 billion per year, this represents a significant opportunity for Canada.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462023"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we dig into the role of embodied carbon in Canada's overall emissions, it is a surprisingly complex picture. At a high level, the advantage of wood rests on the fact that trees grow back and that the carbon stored in wood is stored for as long as the buildings it is used in are still standing. One source I found cited softwood timber as having an embodied carbon footprint of 110 kilograms per cubic metre, compared to 635 kilograms per cubic metre for reinforced concrete.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462024"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admittedly, when we look for figures on the carbon footprint of building materials, we will find a huge range. Therein lies some of the complexity in evaluating different building materials and their climate impacts. However, the benefits of wood as a renewable resource are quite obvious.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462025"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the life cycle climate carbon implications hinge on our management of forests. It is a popular idea to think of Canada's forests as climate-fighting machines that suck carbon out of the atmosphere, but the actual numbers, I think, would surprise people. A couple of years ago it came out that Canada's forests, since 2001, have actually been sources of carbon emissions and have emitted more carbon than they have sucked out of the air. This points to the need to consider the big picture when it comes to the climate implications of forest products.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462026"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jim Pojar, a renowned ecologist based in Smithers, has expressed some caution regarding the notion that forestry is carbon neutral. He writes:</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462027"></a><div>
        <div>
          <div valign="top">
            <div width="15" align="right"></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>It should be emphasized that the underlying carbon budget calculations are complex and depend on assumptions about a future with much uncertainty around carbon dynamics in a rapidly changing environment.</small></div>
</div>
</div>
</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462028"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The approach he advocates is one he calls ‚Äúsmart harvest and...substitution‚Äù, which couples forest management improvements with the substitution of wood in the place of more carbon-intensive building materials. Despite the complexity in evaluating the carbon emissions from different building materials, there does seem to be broad agreement that using wood products in buildings is an important tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462029"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mentioned the beauty of wood, which admittedly is a subjective benefit. Less subjective is the economic impact of manufacturing wood products in regions like the one I live in. So many people I speak with are alarmed by the volume of raw logs we continue to export. They understand intuitively that the more we can add value to our raw resources, the more we can manufacture things, the more people in our communities are going to have jobs and the more benefits we can accrue.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462030"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our region, there are thousands of people employed in forestry: loggers, truck drivers, mill workers, tree planters, foresters and so many more. As we grapple with mid-term timber supply constraints and managing a landscape for multiple values, it becomes ever more important to maximize the number of jobs and the economic benefits from every cubic metre of timber harvested. If we can use public procurement to increase demand for manufactured Canadian wood products, we can spur investment in new manufacturing facilities, new technology and new applications for wood. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462031"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be remiss if I did not mention the Wood Innovation and Design Centre in Prince George, which is home to UNBC's master of engineering in integrated wood design program. It is one example of how, in British Columbia, we are seeking to do more with wood, to innovate and to create models that can be applied around the world.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1155"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1155"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1200"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1200"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1150"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1150" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1155)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I too, as other speakers have, support this legislation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462034"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing I have not heard much of today that I would like to talk about in the short period of time I have is why it makes sense to transition to using more wood products. If we look at the residential buildings built in Ontario recently, we are seeing many more being built taller out of wood. Obviously Ontario has its own building code, but it is informed to a large degree by the national building code. Until recently, within the last decade or so, wood buildings could only be four storeys as the maximum, but now we are seeing that increase quite a bit. Six, seven, eight storeys in different parts of Ontario are permitted to be built out of wood. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462035"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are seeing this shift back towards more wood-based construction not just because of the environmental impacts associated with that and how environmentally unfriendly concrete can be, even though concrete has come a long way in the last couple of decades in terms of its carbon footprint. One of the other things we are seeing is the manner in which we can protect people from fires. Quite frankly, decades ago, when wood was being used a lot, there were not a lot of mitigating measures in place to prevent fires from spreading in structures that had an incredible amount of wood. That is probably why most building codes moved away from using wood towards concrete, particularly in large residential and commercial applications. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462036"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, now there are more fire-suppression tools being used, better ways of suppressing a fire by using certain types of drywall, installing different measures to ensure there is proper egress from buildings in the event of a fire, as well as ensuring that if a fire does occur, there is an opportunity to allow people a certain amount of time to escape before being impacted by‚Äî</div></span></div>

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11954141">Mr. Brian Masse (Windsor West, NDP)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, I am happy to start this week by speaking to Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>. It is quite an extensive bill at over 140 pages in length. It would amend several acts and the most consequential are three of them in particular, as it is an act to enact the consumer privacy protection act, the personal information and data protection tribunal act and the artificial intelligence and data act and to make consequential and related amendments to other acts.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462041"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should start by saying that this is really three pieces of legislation that have been bundled up into one. As New Democrats, we have called for different voting for the third and final part of this act.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462042"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two parts of the act, concerning the consumer privacy protection act and the personal information and data protection tribunal act, do have enough common themes running through them to be put together into one piece of legislation. I still think, for these issues, that they would have been better as two separate pieces of legislation because one of them is brand new and the first one, the consumer privacy protection act, is the former Bill <a id="10950130" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/10950130">C-11</a>, which was highly controversial in the previous Parliament.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462043"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we had an unnecessary election called by the <a id="214296" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/214296/2022-11-28">Prime Minister</a>, that bill died, along with all of the work from Parliament, which was not concluded, despite extensive lobbying and consultation going, particularly, through the ethics committee at that time. This has now been bundled with some other legislation to go through the industry committee, which is fine.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462044"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The personal information and data protection tribunal act is a new component of this legislation. I have some concerns about that element of it, but it does have a common theme, which is worthwhile, and at least it has the potential to be put together and bundled. Although, again, it is extensive, it is a bundling that we can accept.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462045"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have called for a Speaker's ruling with regard to the artificial intelligence and data act, as this is brand new legislation as well, but it does not have the same connections as the previous two pieces, which are bundled together, in the way that one could could argue for them. We want a separate vote on the second part of this because the legislation would be studied at committee together.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462046"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a high degree of interest in this legislation, since Bill <a id="10950130" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/10950130">C-11</a> had that in the past. The new bill changes position from Bill C-11 significantly, and I expect that this in itself will garner a lot of chatter, as well as review and interest, from a number of organizations, many of whom we have already heard from as of now. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462047"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other part, with the tribunal, would be another important aspect, because it is a divergence from our traditional way of enforcement and creates another bureaucratic arm. Again, I would like to see more on this, and I am open to considering the idea, but it is certainly different from our traditional private right of law for dispute settlements about data breaches and other types of corporate malfeasance, that actually have to deal with the types of laws that are necessary to bring compliance among people.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462048"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This goes to the heart of, really, where a political party resides in their expectations of companies and their use of data, information and algorithms. For New Democrats, we fall very much in line with something I have tabled before, several years ago, which is a digital bill of rights, so that one's personal rights online are consistent with that of our physical rights, where one is expected to be properly treated in a physical world and in the digital format world. That includes one's right to privacy, right to the expectation of proper behaviour conducted toward oneself and right to not be abused. It also includes significant penalties to those who do those abuses, especially when we are looking at the corporate world.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462049"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where this legislation really becomes highly complicated is the emergence of artificial intelligence, which has taken place over the last decade and will be significantly ramped up in the years to come. That is why the European Union and others have advanced on this, as well as the United States.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1205"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1205"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1210"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1210"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1200"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1200" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1205)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462050"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our concern is that this bill tries to split both worlds. We all know that the industries of Google and other web giants have conducted significant lobbying efforts over the last number of years. In fact, they have tripled their efforts since this administration has come into place and have had a direct line of correspondence about their lobbying, which is fine to some degree, but the expectation among people that it would be balanced does not seem to be being met.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462051"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to bring into the discussion the impact on people before I get into the technical aspects of the bill, as well as the data breaches that remind us of the need for protection among our citizens and other companies as well. One of the things that is often forgotten is other SMEs, and others can be compromised quite significantly from this, so protecting people individually is just as important for our economy, especially when we have the emergence of new industries. If they are behaviours that are hampered, manipulated or streamed, they can become significant issues.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462052"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to remind people that some of the data breaches we have had with Yahoo, Marriott, the Desjardins group and Facebook, among others, have demonstrated significant differences in the regulatory system between Canada and the United States and how they treat their victims. A good example is a settlement in the U.S. from 2009 with the Equifax data breach, where Equifax agreed to pay $700 million to settle lawsuits over the breach in agreement with the U.S. authorities, and that included $425 million in monetary relief to consumers. We have not had the same type of treatment here in Canada.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462053"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is similar to the work I have done in the past with the auto industry and the fact that our Competition Bureau and our reimbursement systems are not up to date. We have been treated basically as a colony by many of the industries when it comes to consumer and retail accountability. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462054"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can look at the example of Toyota and the data software issue, where the car pedal was blamed for the cars going out of control. It turned out this was not the case. It was actually a data issue. In the U.S., this resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars of investment into safety procedures. We received zero for that. Also, consumers received better treatment, where their vehicles were towed back to different dealerships to be fixed. In Canada, consumers did not receive any of that.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462055"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same could be said with Volkswagen, another situation that took place with emissions. Not only did we not receive compensation similar to that of the United States, we actually imported a lot of the used Volkswagen vehicles from Europe. However, that was of our own accord and time frame when those vehicles were being sunsetted in those countries because of emissions.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462056"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of Facebook, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was able to impose a $5-billion fine for the company's violation, while the Privacy Commissioner's office was forced to take the company to federal court here in Canada. One of the things I would like to point out is that our Privacy Commissioner has stood up for the needs of Canadians, and one of the concerns with this bill would be the erosion of the Privacy Commissioner's capabilities in dealing with these bills and legislation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462057"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Privacy Commissioner has made some significant points on how to amend the bill and actually balance it, but they have not all been taken into account. One of the strong points we will be looking to is to see whether there are necessary amendments from our Privacy Commissioner on this. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462058"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the big distinctions between Canada and the United States, which is to our benefit and to Canada's credit, is the office of the Privacy Commissioner. Where we do not have some of the teeth necessary for dealing with these companies, we do have the independent Privacy Commissioner, who is able to investigate and follow through at least with bringing things to a formal process in the legal system. It is very labourious and difficult, but at the same time, it is independent, which is one of the strengths of the system we have.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462059"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government proceeds, we will see the bill go to committee, which we are agreeing to do. However, we do want to see separate voting. Before I get into more of the bill, I will explain that we want to see separate voting because we really distinguish that this is inappropriate. The artificial intelligence act is the first time we have even dealt with this topic in the House of Commons, and it should be done differently. </div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1210"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1215"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1215"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1205"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1205" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1210)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462060"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be looking for amendments for this, and big corporate data privacy breaches are becoming quite an issue. Some of these privacy breaches get highly complicated to deal with. There have been cases with cybersecurity and even extortion. The University of Calgary is one that was well noted, and there have been others.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462061"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need some of these things brought together. The bill does include some important fixes that we have been calling for, such as stronger enforcement of privacy rights, tough new fines, transparency in corporate decisions made by algorithms.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462062"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have pointed out a lot of the concerns that we have about the bill going forward because of its serious nature. However, we are glad this is happening, albeit with the caveat that we feel the bill should be separate legislation. The <a id="271243" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/271243/2022-11-28">minister</a> does deserve credit for bringing the bill forward for debate in the House of Commons.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462063"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <a id="10950130" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/10950130">C-11</a> should have been passed in the last Parliament, but here we are again dealing with it. The new tribunal is the concern that we have. It could actually weaken existing content rules, and we will study and look at the new tribunal.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462064"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tribunal itself is going to be interesting because it would be an appointment process. There is always a concern when we have a government appointment process. There is a concern that there could be complications setting up the tribunal, such as who gets to go there, what their background is, what their profession is and whether there will be enough support.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462065"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things that gives me trouble is that the CRTC, for example, takes so long to make a decision. It is so labourious to go through and it has not always acted, most recently, in the best interest of Canadians when it comes to consumer protection and individual rights. It gives me concern that having another tribunal to act as a referee instead of the court system could delay things.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462066"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some testimony has been provided already, some analysis, that suggests the tribunal might end up with lawsuits anyway, so we could potentially be back to square one after that. The time duration, funding, the ability to investigate and all these different things are very good issues to look at to find out whether we will have the proper supports for a new measure being brought in.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462067"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another government resource for this is key. At the end of the day, if it is a tribunal system that is not supportive of protecting Canadians' privacy and rights, then we will weaken the entire legislation. That is a big concern because that would be outside Parliament. The way that some of the amendments are written, it could be coming through more regulatory means and less parliamentary oversight.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462068"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who is going to be on the tribunal? How will it be consistent? How will it be regulated? I would point to the minister providing the CRTC with a mandate letter, which is supposed to emphasize the public policy direction it should be going. In my assessment, the CRTC, over the last number of years, has not taken the consumer protection steps that New Democrats would like to see.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462069"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to modernizing this law, we do know that this will be important to address because there are issues regarding the data ownership, which is really at the heart of some of the challenges we face. There is algorithmic abuse and also areas related to compensation, enforcement, data ownership and control, and a number of things that are necessary to ensure the protection of people.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462070"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can look at an area where I have done a fair amount of work related to my riding, which is automobile production. There has been the production of the car and the value there, but there will also be the data collection. The use of that data collection can actually influence not only one's individual behaviour, but also that of society. That is a significant economic resource for some of these companies.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1215"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1215"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1220"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1220"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1210"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1210" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1215)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462071"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one of the reasons I have tabled an update to my bill on the right to repair. The right to repair is a person's ability to have their vehicle fixed at an auto shop of their choice in the aftermarket. The OEMs, the original manufacturers, have at times resisted this. There have been examples. Tesla, for example, is not even part of what is called the voluntary agreement, but we still do not have an update with regard to the use of data and how one actually goes about the process of fixing the vehicle.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462072"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also creates issues related to ownership of the vehicle, as well as insurance and liability. These could become highly complicated issues related to the use of data and the rules around it. If these types of things are not clear with regard to the process of rights for people, expectations by those who are using the data, and protection for people, then it could create a real, significant issue, not only for individuals but for our economy.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462073"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, dealing with this issue in the bill is paramount. A lot of this has come about by looking at what the GDPR, the general data protection regulation, did in European law. Europe was one of the first jurisdictions to bring forth this type of an issue, and it has provided an adequate level of protection, which is one of the things Europe stands by with regard to protection of privacy. There have been some on the side over here in North America who have pushed back against the GDPR, and even though this landmark legislation has created a path forward, there still is a need for transparency and to understand what the monetary penalties for abuse are going to be, which are also very important in terms of what we expect in the legislation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462074"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erosion of content rights is one of the things we are worried about in this bill. Under Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> individuals would have significantly diminished control over the collection, use and disclosure of their personal data, even less than in Bill <a id="10950130" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/10950130">C-11</a>. The new consent provisions ask the public to install an exemplary amount of trust to businesses to keep them accountable, as the bill's exceptions to content allow organizations to conduct many types of activities without any knowledge of the individuals. The flexibility under Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> allows organizations to state the scope not only of legitimate interests but also of what is reasonable, necessary and socially beneficial, thus modelling their practices in a way that maximizes the value derived from the personal information.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462075"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have there is that the actors are setting some of the rules. That is one of the clearer things that we need through the discussion that would take place at committee, but also from the testimony that we will hear, because if we are letting those who use and manage the data make the decision about what consent is and how it is used, then it is going to create a system that could really lead to abuse.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462076"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the issue or danger of de-identification. Witnesses, artificial intelligence and people being able to scrub much of their data when they want and how they want is one of the things we are concerned about. There is not enough acknowledgement of the risk that is available in this. That includes for young people. We believe this bill is a bit lopsided towards the business sector at the moment, and we want to propose amendments that would lead to better protection of individual rights and ensure informed consent as to what people want to do with their data and how they want it to be exercised as a benefit to them and their family, versus people being accidentally or wilfully brought into exposure they have not consented to.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462077"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I wrap up, I just want to say that we have a number of different issues with this bill. Again, we believe there should be a separate vote for the second part of this bill, being the third piece of it. It is very ambitious legislation. It is as large as the budget bill. That should say enough with regard to the type of content we have. I thank the members who have debated this bill already. It is going to be interesting to get all perspectives.

The subject before us is sensitive and extremely complex. As has been mentioned several times, we are wading into areas that have not been regulated until now. It is very important to take the time to get it right. Certain conditions are obviously needed. For example, all legislation must be adapted to legislation that already exists in the provinces and in Quebec. As we know, orders in council issued during the previous Parliament guaranteed that there would be no encroachment on provincial jurisdictions if equivalent legislation exists in those provinces.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462089"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if my colleague could confirm whether his party is committed to not encroaching on provincial jurisdictions. Unfortunately, his party usually has a hard time respecting what happens in the provinces and wants to centralize everything at the federal level. I want him to understand that things might be more efficient if we can avoid duplicate structures. That is the first part of my question, which is fundamental. Furthermore, his political party has a tendency to pass legislation very quickly using gag orders, which are supported by the party. It concerns me that such an important piece of legislation is being voted on after limited debate.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462090"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the member commit to respecting the time allotted for debate on this bill and to respecting Quebec's jurisdictions?</div></span></div>

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11954536">Mrs. Brenda Shanahan (Ch√¢teauguay‚ÄîLacolle, Lib.)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for <a id="278589" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/278589/2022-11-28">York Centre</a>.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462105"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak to the <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">digital charter implementation act, 2022</a>, in particular the aspect on the consumer privacy protection act. If I have time, I will also discuss the artificial intelligence and data act.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462106"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud to speak to these two pieces of legislation that introduce a regime that seeks to not only support the technological transformation, but also help Canadians safely navigate this new digital world with confidence. These past few years, Canadians have witnessed these technological shifts take place. They have taken advantage of new technologies like never before. In 2021, more than 72.5% of Canadians used e-commerce services, a trend that is expected to grow to 77.6% by 2025.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462107"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to TECHNATION, a 10% increase in digitalization can create close to a 1% drop in the unemployment rate. What is more, every 1% increase in digitalization can add $8.7¬†billion to Canada's GDP. In order to take advantage of those major benefits for our economy, we must ensure that consumers continue to have confidence in the digital marketplace.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462108"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technology is clearly an intrinsic part of our lives, and Canadians have growing expectations regarding the digital economy. It is absolutely essential that the Government of Canada be able to meet those expectations. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462109"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this bill, the government is putting forward a regime that gives Canadians the protection they deserve. First, as stated in the preamble of the digital charter implementation act, 2022, Canada recognizes the importance of protecting Canadians' privacy rights. Similarly, the 2022 consumer privacy protection act also provides important protections for Canadians.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462110"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, our government has listened to the input of various stakeholders, and we have made changes to improve this bill. I was on the committee in the last Parliament, and there was a lot of discussion about the previous bill, Bill¬†<a id="10950130" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/10950130">C‚Äë11</a>. I am very pleased to be able to speak to Bill¬†<a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>, so that we can get all that work done in this Parliament.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462111"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important changes we have made is enhancing protection for minors. Some stakeholders felt that the previous legislation did not go far enough to protect children's privacy. I agree. Consequently, the bill was amended to define minors' information as sensitive by default. This means that organizations subject to the law will have to adhere to higher standards of protection for that information. The legislation also provides minors with a more direct route to delete their personal information. This will make it easier for them to manage their online reputation. I think this is a really important change, because we know that young people are very aware and very capable of using all types of digital platforms, but at the same time, we need to make sure that they are able to protect their reputation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462112"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to protections for minors, we also made changes to the concept of de-identification of personal information. According to many stakeholders, the definitions in the old bill were confusing. We recognize that having well-defined terms helps ensure compliance with the act and provides more effective protection of consumers' information. In that regard, I understand that, because we are talking about new technologies and an evolving industry, it is important for all members to share their expertise, since that will help us develop a better piece of legislation.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1235"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1240"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1240"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1230"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1230" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1235)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462113"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference, then, between anonymous information and de-identified information needs to be clarified because, clearly, if information is de-identified but an organization or company is able to reidentify it, that does not serve the purpose of having anonymous information.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462114"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data-based innovation offers many benefits for Canadians. These changes contribute to appropriate safeguards to prevent unauthorized reidentification of this information, while offering greater flexibility in the use of de-identified information.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462115"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new law also maintains the emphasis on controlling the use of their personal information by individuals. That remains a foundation of the law, namely that individuals must be able to fully understand the purpose for which information will be used and consent to that purpose in the most important circumstances.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462116"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the modern economy must also have flexible tools to accommodate situations that are beneficial but that may not require consent if the organization respects certain limits and takes steps to protect individuals.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462117"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach advocated here continues to be based on the concept of individual control, but proposes a new exception to consent to resolve these gaps as a tool for safeguarding privacy. The new provisions propose a general exception to cover situations in which organizations could use personal information without obtaining consent, provided that they can justify their legitimate interest in its use for circumstances in which the individual expects the information to be used.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462118"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, to prevent abuse, the exception is subject to a requirement that the organization mitigate the risk. For example, digital mapping applications that take photos of every street and that we use to view them, particularly to help with navigation, are widely accepted as being beneficial. However, obtaining individual consent from every resident of the city is impossible.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462119"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that everyone in the House will agree that it is hard to imagine how we managed before we had access to those navigation applications. Last evening, I had a visit with a family member in Ottawa and was very happy to have my mapping application to find my destination.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462120"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of an exception, combined with a mitigation requirement, therefore allows individuals to take advantage of a beneficial service while safeguarding personal information. The example shows another key aspect for building trust and transparency. Digital mapping technology presents a certain level of transparency. The vehicles equipped with cameras can be seen on our streets and the results can also be seen posted and available online.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462121"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are some technologies or aspects thereof that are more difficult to see and understand. That is why the bill continues granting individuals the right to ask organizations for an explanation regarding any prediction, recommendation or decision made in their regard by an automated decision-making system.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462122"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, these explanations must be provided in plain language that the individual can understand. These provisions also support the proposed new artificial intelligence act. However, I do not think that I have time to get into that, so I will end there.</div></span></div>

As we know, over the past few years, we have witnessed the constant evolution of our digital environment. Canadians have been successfully navigating through this changing environment, but they have also made it clear to us that they want better protection of their privacy. They want to be able to benefit from the latest emerging technologies with the confidence that they can be used safely. Canadians also believe that organizations need to be fully accountable for how they manage personal information and how they go about developing powerful technologies, such as artificial intelligence, or AI. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462136"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the beginning of our consultations on digital and data, stakeholders have stressed the importance of maintaining flexibility to innovate responsibly and maintain access to markets at home and abroad. I am proud to say that the digital charter implementation act, 2022, which would enact the consumer privacy protection act, or CPPA, and the artificial intelligence and data act, or AIDA, would do just that. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462137"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPPA represents a complete transformation of Canada's private sector privacy regime, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA, which came into force in 2001. That was 20 or so years ago. CPPA would introduce significant changes to better protect Canadians' personal information, including strong fiscal and financial consequences for those who seek to benefit from curtailing their legal obligations. This new framework would also ensure that all Canadians could enjoy the same privacy protections as individuals have in other countries. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462138"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The AIDA, for its part, is being proposed to build confidence in a key part of the data-driven economy. This part of the bill would introduce common standards for responsible design, development and deployment of AI systems. It would also provide businesses with much-needed guardrails for AI innovation and would ensure that Canadians can trust the AI systems that underpin the data economy. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462139"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PIPEDA was passed at the start of the century when other countries and some provinces were moving forward with privacy laws governing the private sector. Recognizing the potential for a patchwork of provincial privacy laws to emerge and the need to align internationally, Canada put in place PIPEDA as a national privacy standard. It drew on best practices to provide robust privacy protections for increased consumer confidence and a consistent and flexible regulatory environment for businesses that allowed for legitimate use of personal information. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462140"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key element for alignment was the recognition of provincial private sector privacy laws as substantially similar. This meant that, where such a law is given that designation, PIPEDA did not apply to an organization's activities within that province. PIPEDA would continue, however, to apply to the federally regulated sector in that province and to any personal information collected, used or disclosed in the course of commercial activities across borders. This has provided a stable regulatory environment and flexibility for provinces, and it has supported Canada's trade interests well for many years. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462141"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, history is repeating itself, but the stakes are much higher. The role of the digital economy is far more central to our lives than it was 20 years ago. To harness all that the modern digital world has to offer, we clearly need to modernize our federal private sector privacy law. The provinces are moving in that direction and, again, the risk of fragmentation looms. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462142"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec has amended its private sector privacy law, and B.C. and Alberta are examining their private sector privacy laws as well. Ontario too is considering introducing a new private sector privacy law. Therefore, the federal government must act now to ensure that all Canadians benefit from a substantially equivalent degree of protection and facilitate compliance for organizations that do business across the country. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462143"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like PIPEDA, the CPPA is grounded in the federal trade and commerce powers. It builds on the best practices developed internationally and by Canadian provinces, and it foregrounds the importance of the ease of doing business across boundaries. The CPPA replicates the approach under PIPEDA, and it updates the mechanism in regulations for recognizing provincial laws as substantially similar. The regulations will set out the criteria and process for such recognition and will continue to provide the flexibility that has been important to PIPEDA's success.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1250"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1255"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1255"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1245"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1245" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1250)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462144"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CPPA, like its predecessor, would also maintain the Privacy Commissioner's ability to collaborate and co-operate with his or her provincial counterparts. This is an important tool to ensure consistency, guidance and enforcement, and one that has enabled our commissioners to lead the world in privacy collaboration and co-operation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462145"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada also needs to move proactively to regulate in the AI space, given that the operation of these systems transcends national and provincial borders in the digital environment. AIDA would create a common standard that all organizations involved in international and inter-provincial trade and commerce would have to meet. AIDA would place Canada at the forefront of international regulation in the AI space and would provide clear rules across the country. This would spur innovation and build confidence in the safety of AI systems used or developed in Canada.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462146"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in an interconnected world. Data is constantly flowing across borders. In 2001, the European Commission recognized PIPEDA as providing adequate protection relative to EU law, allowing for the free flow of personal information between Canadian and European businesses.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462147"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2018, a new EU regulation came into effect that was known as the general data protection regulation. It updated many of the existing requirements and added strong financial penalties for contraventions. The EU is currently reviewing its existing adequacy decisions, including the one that applies to Canada. We expect to hear more on the outcome of this review soon.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462148"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CPPA would make a positive contribution to maintaining Canada's adequacy with the EU privacy regime. It would enable personal data from EU businesses to continue to flow to Canada without additional protections. Beyond the EU, the changes proposed in the CPPA would represent important updates that would bring us in line with other international jurisdictions that have updated their laws. It would ensure interoperability with consistent rules, rights and consequences.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462149"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other jurisdictions internationally are also moving ahead on their AI regulation, and strong action is needed to maintain Canada's leadership position internationally. Interoperability with international partners remains a key priority. The EU in particular has advanced a framework for regulating AI that would set standards for any AI systems being deployed in the EU market.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462150"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AIDA would propose a risk-based approach that would ensure interoperability with the EU while keeping in mind that Canadian context is unique. For example, AIDA would include flexible compliance options in order to ensure that our many small to medium-sized businesses would not be left behind. The proposed AIDA would represent an opportunity for Canada to lead internationally, would ensure market access for Canadian companies and would uphold Canadian values.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462151"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government launched Canada's digital charter in 2019. Its 10 guiding principles offer a foundation on which to build an innovative and inclusive digital and data-driven economy. Ensuring interoperability, a level playing field, strong enforcement and real accountability are clearly reflected in the digital charter implementation act, 2022.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462152"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure colleagues that our approach is pragmatic, principled and meets our trading needs. The bill would provide a consistent, coherent framework that Canadians and stakeholders could rely on. With Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> we would continue to encourage trade and investment and to grow an economy that would extend across provincial and international borders alike.</div></span></div>

Despite demands from privacy advocates over the last few years, the government has failed to recognize privacy as a fundamental right in the preamble. The bill states that individuals' personal information should have the ‚Äúfull enjoyment of fundamental rights‚Äù. This is clever language that avoids giving personal privacy the recognition that it is a fundamental right or a fundamental human right.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462173"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wording ‚Äúfull enjoyment of fundamental rights‚Äù in the preamble needs to be amended from ‚Äúof fundamental rights‚Äù to ‚Äúas a fundamental right‚Äù. Furthermore, leaving this strictly in the preamble reduces if not eliminates any real legal impact. If privacy is a fundamental right, for it to have true force in this bill it needs to be included as well in clause 5, which notes the purpose of the bill.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462174"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is privacy a fundamental right? Freedom of thought, freedom of speech and freedom to be left alone are derived from privacy. The legal protections of privacy limit government's intrusion into our lives. In free and democratic societies, we consider these freedoms as essential rights. The rights to think what I want, to say what I want and to be free to choose what I do, what I am interested in and whom I interact with and where I do that in our digital world are data points. To me they are personal information and therefore are part of a fundamental right to privacy.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462175"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does this mean? It means privacy rights under law are prioritized over commercial rights. A rights-based approach serves as an effective check on technology's potential dangers while ensuring businesses can function and thrive.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1300"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1305"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1305"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1255"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1255" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1300)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462176"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government officials have told me this cannot be recognized in the bill the way it needs to be to have true meaning under law and force because it would intrude on provincial jurisdiction. I do not agree, and neither does the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. Both levels of government can regulate privacy and do. The federal government's role is to regulate aspects under its control, including the fact that commerce does not follow provincial boundaries and therefore requires federal oversight.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462177"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that most Canadians accept and expect their data to be used to enhance their experiences and needs in our modern society. I also believe that for organizations to obtain the data of Canadians, Canadians must first consent to it, and that if these same organizations find new uses of our data, they need to get express consent as well. Canadians want their data safely protected and not used for things they did not give permission for, and if they choose to end a relationship with a service provider, they want their personal data to be destroyed.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462178"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe Canadians want their personal data sold to other entities without their express consent, and how does Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> deal with these expectations of Canadians? I think poorly. The legislation, in the summary section, states that the dual purpose of the bill is to ‚Äúgovern the protection of personal information of individuals while taking into account the need of organizations to collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.‚Äù What it would not do is place personal privacy rights above commercial interests.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462179"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would require express consent in clause 15, and that is true, but a great deal of the bill goes on to describe the many ways in which consent would not be required and how it would be left up to the discretion of the organization that has collected the data if it needs consent for its usage. The bill is also weak in terms of making sure individuals understand consent when given. For consent to be meaningful, the usages proposed must be understood. The lack of definition and the placement of burden of interpretation on businesses expose those same businesses to legal action and penalties if they get it wrong. This lack of clarity may stifle innovation in Canada as a result. The bill needs to ensure that individuals understand the nature, purpose and consequences of the collection, use and disclosure of the information to which they are consenting. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462180"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the bill would give organizations the right to use information in new ways and would require businesses to get an update to consent for this information. That is good and necessary, but the bill would also enable organizations to use the implied consent in subclause 15(5). When combined with paragraph 18(2)(d), this would give businesses carte blanche to use implied consent rather than express consent.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462181"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An organization can decide on its own that the original consent implies consent for a new purpose, and they do not need to seek the individual's views. This is a version of the old negative option marketing that was outlawed in the 1990s. Either someone gives consent, or they do not. There is no such thing as implied consent, in my view, and this needs to be removed from the bill.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462182"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, the bill uses the term ‚Äúsensitive information‚Äù, which companies and organizations must determine to protect data, but it does not anywhere in the more than 100 pages define what ‚Äúsensitive information‚Äù is. It needs to be defined in the bill to include information revealing racial and ethnic origin, gender identity, sexual orientation and religious and other affiliations. These are just a few examples.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462183"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is not the worst of it. Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> would introduce a concept called ‚Äúlegitimate interest‚Äù. This is a new rule that would rank an individual's interests and fundamental rights below those of the organization that gathered the information, the exact opposite of what a personal privacy bill should do. To do this, subclause 18(3) would allow an organization or business to use information if it has a legitimate interest in doing so. However, here is where it really gets goofy: To try to reduce businesses using our data under the legitimate interest clause for their own needs over ours, the Liberals have decided to limit the power under paragraph 18(3)(b). This clause could prohibit the business or organization from using our information for the purpose of influencing behaviour.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1305"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1310"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1310"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1300"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1300" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1305)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462184"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than 20 years, since the invention of loyalty and rewards programs, retailers have used people's data to offer products they might enjoy based on their purchasing patterns. Have members ever bought wine online or in store because it said, ‚ÄúIf you like this, you might enjoy this alternative‚Äù? Have members ever watched a show on Netflix because it was recommended? Have members ever listened to a song on Spotify because it was recommended based on what else they had listened to? Well, guess what. Paragraph 18(3)(b) could now make this service illegal.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462185"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals cannot get express consent right, and they are allowing companies to use people's data with implied consent or no consent at all. The Liberals are also putting the business use of people's personal data above their privacy rights. That is why it is really the no privacy bill. At the same time, the Liberals are making illegal the good parts of what businesses do in enhancing the customer experience by removing the ability to study purchasing patterns and offering products that we might enjoy because of paragraph 18(3)(b). This bill makes influencing people's decisions illegal.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462186"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <a id="271243" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/271243/2022-11-28">minister</a> said to me and mentioned in the House in his opening speech on the bill, as have other members today, that he is proud to be protecting children from harm in this digital bill. This 100-page legislation has only one clause related to children. Subclause 2(2), under ‚ÄúDefinitions‚Äù, states that ‚Äúinformation of minors is considered to be sensitive‚Äù, but the bill does not define ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù nor does it define what a minor is. Officials tell me that the definition of a minor is determined by provincial law, so each province would have different rules, and companies would have to comply with the different rules in every province.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462187"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the protection of children were really a major purpose, this legislation would devote some space to defining both what a minor is and what sensitive information is. During COVID, minors used many online apps and programs to continue their formal education. There were then and still are no protections under law as to what is done with their data. This technology would be a new normal for our education system. The online surveillance of children resulting from the COVID experience is huge and protections are zero, even with this bill.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462188"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill needs to define in law, not regulation, age-appropriate consent for minors, and comprehensive rules to prevent the collection, manipulation and use of any minor's data. This bill leaves it up to businesses to decide what is sensitive and appropriate for minors. It is a colossal failure on the <a id="271243" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/271243/2022-11-28">minister</a>'s main selling point for this no privacy bill.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462189"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is silent on the selling of personal data. It needs provisions on the limits and obligations of data brokers. The bill is silent on the use of facial recognition technology. The bill also prohibits using data in a way that produces significant harm and defines it inadequately. For example, psychological harm caused by a data breach and embarrassment caused by privacy loss are not included. The damages role needs to be expanded to include moral damages, since most contraventions of privacy do not involve provable, quantifiable damages.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462190"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating more government bureaucracy and growth is the true legacy of the Liberals in government. This bill is no exception, with the creation of a body to appeal the Privacy Commissioner's rulings to. The appointed new body of non-lawyers is called the personal protection and data tribunal, and it is the second part of the bill. Frankly, these powers, if they really are important, should be given to the Privacy Commissioner to eliminate the middle man of bureaucracy. There is no need for this tribunal.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462191"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, let us turn to the ill-conceived, poorly structured and ill-defined artificial intelligence part of Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>. It really needs to be removed from this legislation and puts this bill's passage into question. AI is a valid area to legislate, but only with a bill that has a legislative goal.

    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462192"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essentially, this part of Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> would drive all work on AI out of Canada to countries with clearer government legislation.

The minister can make law, investigate violations, determine guilt and impose penalties without ever going to Parliament, cabinet or any third party.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462194"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a massive overreach and is anti-democratic in an area critical to Canada's innovation agenda. Promises of consultation in the process of crafting regulations is too little, too late. It puts too much power in the hands of unelected officials and the minister.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462195"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition in the bill of what AI is, and therefore what it wants total regulatory power over, is a system that autonomously processes date related to human activities using a genetic algorithm, a neural network, machine learning or other networks to make recommendations or predictions. If we think this is futuristic, it is not. It is already happening in warfare to determine and execute bombings.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462196"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without parliamentary oversight, the bill introduces the concept of ‚Äúhigh-impact systems‚Äù. It does not define what that is, but it will be defined in regulation and managed in regulation. No regulatory power should ever be given to the minister or the Governor in Council for anything that is not defined in law.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462197"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing the bill defines is the unprecedented power to rule all over this industry and the fines to those who breach the unwritten regulations. The massive financial and jail penalties that extend down to the developers and the university researchers for undefined breaches of law as part of the statute are huge.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462198"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless this portion of the bill is separated when members vote, this AI section is reason alone that the bill should be defeated. AI is a significant need, but it needs a proper legislative framework, one that is actually developed with consultation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462199"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all members to read the bill carefully. Current privacy laws need amendment, but the current law is preferable to this ill-defined proposal. The AI bill would drive innovation and business out of Canada's economy, making us less competitive.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462200"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hard to believe anyone could get this legislation so wrong, especially since this is the second time the Liberals have proposed updating our privacy laws. Without splitting the bill, without having separate votes and without considerable amendments in committee in the first two parts, the bill should be defeated.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462201"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all members to consider this seriously in their deliberations as we go on to the many speeches that we will hear. While this is a critical point of updating our personal privacy, the bill, in its current state, does not do it and it gives equal if not greater rights to businesses and organizations than it does to individuals.</div></span></div>

The last time was over 20 years ago. Twenty years might not seem like a long time, but when we think about it, 20 years ago Facebook was probably just a program Mark Zuckerberg was working on in his dorm room.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462228"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we think of iPhones, they were pretty much non-existent 20 years ago. Smart phones were out, but they certainly did not have anywhere near the capabilities they do today. So many other technologies we have come to rely on now have been getting smarter over the years. They are acting in different manners and are able to do the work they do because of the data being collected from individual users.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462229"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another great example would be Google. Twenty years ago it was nothing more than literally a search engine. One had to type into the Google form what one was looking for. Sometimes one had to put weird characters or a plus symbol between words in the search terms. It literally was just a table of contents accessing information for people. However, now it is so much more than that. How many of us have, at some point, said to somebody that we would love to get a new air fryer, and then suddenly, the next day or later that day, we see in Google, on Facebook, or whatever it might be, advertisements for air fryers that keep popping up. I am sure that sometimes it is a coincidence, but I know in my experience it seems it happens way too often to be a coincidence.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462230"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the results of new technologies that are coming along, and in particular AI, that are able to work algorithms and build new ones based on the information being fed into the system. Of course the more information that gets fed in, the smarter the technologies get and the more they are looking to feed off new data that can give them even further precision with respect to advertising and targeting tools at people. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462231"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not just about selling advertising. AI can also lead to incredible advancements in technology that we otherwise would not have been able to get to, such as advancements in health and the automotive industry. If we think of our vehicles, the big thing now in new cars is the lane-assist feature, which uses technology such as lidar to read signals in the road.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462232"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is technology that, when we enter our passwords to confirm we are human beings, sometimes requires us to pick different things from pictures. When we do that, we are feeding information back into helping those images be properly placed. We are not just confirming that we are human beings; there is an incredible amount of data being used to give better evaluations to various different formulas and equations based on the things we do.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462233"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we think of things like intelligent and autonomous vehicles, which basically drive themselves, 20 years ago would we ever have thought a car could actually drive itself? We are pretty much halfway there. We are at a point where vehicles are able to see and identify roads and know where they need to be, what the hazards are, and what the possible threats are that exist with respect to that drive.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462234"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more important is that, when I get into my vehicle, drive it around and engage with other vehicles, it is analyzing all of this data and sending that information back to help develop that AI system for intelligent vehicles to make it even better and more predictive. It is not just the data that goes into the AI, but also the data that it can generate and then further feed to the algorithms to make it even better.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1330"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1335"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1335"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1325"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1325" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1330)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462235"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very obvious that things have changed quite a bit in 20 years. We are nowhere near where we were 20 years ago. We are so much further ahead, but we have to be conscious of what is happening to that data we are submitting. Sometimes, as I mentioned in a previous question, it can be data that is submitted anonymously for the purposes of being used to help algorithms around lidar and self-driving vehicles, for example. At other times it can be data that can be used for commercial, marketing and advertising purposes.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462236"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think of my children. My six-year-old, who is in grade one, is developing his reading quite quickly. Two years ago, even at the age of four, when he would be playing a video game and would not be able to figure out how to get past a certain level, he would walk up to my wife's iPad and basically say, ‚ÄúHey, Siri, how do I do this?‚Äù</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462237"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just saying that, I probably set off a bunch of phones to listen to what I am saying, but the point is that we have children who, already at such a young age, are using this technology. I did not grow up being able to say, ‚ÄúHey, Siri, how do I do this or that?‚Äù</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462238"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have to be really concerned about is the development of children and the development of minors, what they are doing and how that can impact them and their privacy. I am very relieved to see there is a big component of this that, in my opinion, aims to ensure the privacy of minors is maintained, even though I have heard the concern or the criticism from some members today that the definition of ‚Äúminor‚Äù needs to be better reflected in the legislation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462239"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel as though if it is not known what a minor is, in terms of how it relates to this legislation, then I believe this is something that can be worked out in committee. It is something to which the governing members would be more than welcome, in terms of listening to the discussion around that and why or why not further clarifying the definition is important.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462240"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to just back up a second and talk more specifically about the three parts of this bill and what they would do. The summary reads as follows:</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462241"></a><div>
        <div>
          <div valign="top">
            <div width="15" align="right"></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Part 1 enacts the Consumer Privacy Protection Act to govern the protection of personal information of individuals while taking into account the need of organizations to collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of commercial activities.</small></div>
</div>
</div>
</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462242"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A consequence of this first part would be to repeal other older pieces of legislation. I think this is absolutely critical, because this goes back to what I have been talking about in terms of how things have changed over the last 20 years. We are now at a place where we really do not know what information we are giving or is being used from us. I realize, as some other colleagues have indicated, 99.9% of the time, we always click that ‚Äúyes, I accept the terms‚Äù without reading the terms and conditions, not knowing exactly how our information is being used and what is actually being linked directly back to us.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462243"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the consumer privacy protection act, there would be protections in place for the personal information of individuals while, at the same time, really respecting the need to ensure companies can still innovate, because it is important to innovate. It is important to see these technologies do better.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462244"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite frankly, it is important for me personally, and this will be very selfish of me, that, when I am watching on Netflix a show that I really like, I get recommendations of other shows I might really like. As the member for <a id="278139" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/278139/2022-11-28">South Shore‚ÄîSt. Margarets</a> mentioned earlier, when it comes to Spotify, it is important to me also that, when I start listening to certain music, other music gets suggested to me based on what other people who share similar interests to mine have liked, and how these algorithms end up generating that content for me.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462245"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to ensure that companies, if we want them to continue to innovate on these incredible technologies we have, can have access to data. However, it is even more important that they be responsible with respect to that innovation. There has to be the proper balance between privacy and innovation, how people are innovating and how that data is being used.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1335"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1340"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1340"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1330"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1330" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1335)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462246"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen examples in recent years, whether in the United States or in Canada, where data that has been collected has been used in a manner not in keeping with how that data was supposed to be used. There has to be a comprehensive act in place that properly identifies how that data is going to be used, because, quite frankly, the last time this legislation was updated, 20 years ago, we had no idea how that data would be used today. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462247"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By encouraging responsible innovation and ensuring we have the proper terminology in the legislation, companies would know exactly what they should and should not be doing, how they should be engaging with that data, what they need to do with that data at various times, how to keep it secure and safe and, most importantly, how to maintain the privacy of individuals. It is to the benefit not just of individuals in 2022, or 2023 almost, to have data that is being properly secured. It is also very important and to the benefit of the businesses, so that they know what the rules are and what the playing field is like when it comes to accessing that data.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462248"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of this bill, as has been mentioned:</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462249"></a><div>
        <div>
          <div valign="top">
            <div width="30" align="right"></div>
<div><small>...enacts the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act, which establishes an administrative tribunal to hear appeals of certain decisions made by the Privacy Commissioner under the Consumer Privacy Protection Act and to impose penalties for the contravention of certain provisions of that Act.</small></div>
</div>
</div>
</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462250"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is absolutely critical, because there has to be somewhere people can go to ensure that, if they have a concern from a consumer perspective over the way their data is used and they are not happy with the result from the commissioner, they have an avenue to appeal those decisions. If we do not do that, and we put too much power in the hands of a few individuals, or in this case the Privacy Commissioner under the consumer protection act, if we give all that power and do not have the ability for an appeal mechanism, then we will certainly run into problems down the road. This legislation would help ensure that the commissioner is kept in check, and it would also help consumers have the faith they need to have in terms of accountability when it comes to their data and whether it is being used and maintained in a safe way.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462251"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third part of the bill is the more controversial in terms of whether or not it should be part of this particular legislation or in a separate vote. The summary reads:</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462252"></a><div>
        <div>
          <div valign="top">
            <div width="15" align="right"></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Part 3 enacts the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act to regulate international and interprovincial trade and commerce in artificial intelligence systems by requiring that certain persons adopt measures to mitigate the risks of harm and biased output related to high-impact artificial intelligence systems.</small></div>
</div>
</div>
</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462253"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That act would provide for public reporting and authorizes the minister to order the production of records related to artificial intelligence systems. The act also would establish prohibitions related to the possession or use of illegally obtained personal information for the purpose of designing, developing, using or making available for use an artificial intelligence system in an intentional or reckless way that causes material harm to individuals.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462254"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the consequences of artificial intelligence, quite frankly, is that if we allow all of this biased information to be fed into the artificial intelligence systems and be used to create and produce results for important algorithms, then we run the risk of those results being biased as well if the inputs are going to be that way. Therefore, ensuring that there are proper measures in place to ensure individuals are not going to be treated in a biased manner is going to require true accountability.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1340"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1345"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1345"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1335"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1335" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1340)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462255"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that artificial intelligence, even in its current form, is very hard to predict. It is very hard to understand exactly when a person is being impacted by something being generated from an artificially intelligent form. Quite often, a lot of the interactions we already have on a day-to-day basis are based on these artificial intelligence features that are using various different inputs in order to determine what we should be doing or how we should be engaging with something. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462256"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that if this is done in a biased manner or in a manner that is intentionally reckless, people might not be aware of that until it is well past the point, so it is important to ensure that we have all of the proper measures in place to protect individuals against those who would try to use artificial intelligence in a manner that would intentionally harm them.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462257"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I come to the conclusion of my remarks, I will go back to what I talked about in the beginning, that artificial intelligence, quite frankly, has a lot of benefits to it. It is going to transform just about everything in our lives: how we interact with individuals, how we interact with technologies, how we are cared for, how we move around by transportation, how we make decisions, as we already know, on what to listen to or what to watch. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462258"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incredibly important that as this technology develops and artificial intelligence becomes more and more common, we ensure that we are in the driver's seat in terms of understanding what is going into that and making sure we are fully aware of anybody who might be breaking rules as they relate to the use of artificial intelligence. It will become more difficult, quite frankly, as the artificial intelligence forms take on new responsibilities and meanings to create new decisions and outputs, and we must ensure that we are in a position to always be in the driver's seat and have the proper oversight that is required.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462259"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that some concerns have been brought forward today by different members. At first glance, when the member for <a id="278139" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/278139/2022-11-28">South Shore‚ÄîSt. Margarets</a> and others brought forward the concern around the definition of a ‚Äúminor‚Äù, which is not something I thought of when I originally looked at this bill, I can appreciate, especially after hearing his response to my question, why it is necessary to put a proper definition in there. I hope the bill gets to committee and the committee can study some of those important questions so we can keep moving this along.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462260"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I certainly do not feel as though we should just be abandoning this bill altogether because we might have concerns about one thing or another. The reality, and what we know for certain, is that things have changed quite a bit in the last 20 years since the legislation was last updated. We need to start working on this now. We need to get it to committee, and the proper studies need to occur at this point so we can properly ensure that individuals' privacy and protection are taken care of as they relate to the three particular parts I talked about today.</div></span></div>

I think it was just Mark Zuckerberg and some of his college friends, and look where we are now and not only the way Facebook, Instagram and all those other social media services impact our daily lives in the sense that we are using them, but also how they are selling stuff to us, collecting information from us and feeding stuff back to us.

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11954998">Mrs. Cathay Wagantall (Yorkton‚ÄîMelville, CPC)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, for the average citizen in the digital age, we have entered uncertain times. To almost everyone, at face value, the convenience of our time is remarkable. Access to any piece of information is available at our fingertips. Any item imaginable can seamlessly be ordered and delivered to our doors. Many government services can be processed online instead of in person. Canadians have taken these conveniences for granted for many years now.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462291"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pandemic accelerated our ascent, or descent, depending on who you ask, into the digital age. The inability to leave our homes and the necessity to maintain some rhythm of everyday life played a significant part in that, but around the world, we saw governments taking advantage of the plight of their citizens. Public health was used as a catalyst for implementing methods of tracking and control, and social media platforms, which have been putting a friendly face on exploiting our likes, dislikes and movements for years, continue to develop and implement that technology with little input or say from their millions of users.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462292"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Canadians no longer can be sure that their personal information will not be outed, or doxed, to the public if doing so would achieve some certain political objective. We saw that unfold earlier this year with the users of the GiveSendGo platform.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462293"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The long-term ramifications of our relationship with the digital economy is something Canadians are beginning to understand. They are now alert to the fact that organizations, companies and government departments operating in Canada today do not face notable consequences for breaking our privacy laws. As lawmakers, it is our responsibility to ensure that Canadians‚Äô privacy is protected and that this protection continues to evolve as threats to our information and anonymity as consumers unrelentingly expands both within and beyond our borders.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462294"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the bill we are discussing today, Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>. It is another attempt to introduce a digital charter after the previous iteration of the bill, Bill <a id="10950130" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/10950130">C-11</a>, died on the Order Paper in the last Parliament. My colleagues and I believe that striking the right balance is at the core of the debate on this bill. On the one hand, it seeks to update privacy laws and regulations that have not been modernized since the year 2000 and implemented in 2005. It would be hard to describe the scale of expansion in the digital world over the last 22-year period in a mere 20-minute speech. It is therefore appropriate that a bill in any form, particularly one as long-awaited as Bill C-27, is considered by Parliament to fill the privacy gaps we see in Canada‚Äôs modern-day digital economy.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462295"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament must also balance the need for modernization of privacy protection with the imperative that our small and medium-sized businesses remain competitive. Many of these businesses sustain themselves through the hard work of two or three employees, or perhaps even just a sole proprietor. We must be sensitive to their concerns, as Canada improves its image as a friendly destination for technology, data and innovation. This is especially true as our economic growth continues to recover from the damaging impact of pandemic lockdowns, crippling taxes that continue to rise and ever-increasing red tape.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462296"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That extra layer of red tape may very well be the catalyst for many small businesses to close their operations. No one in the House would like to see a further consolidation of Canadians‚Äô purchasing power in big players such as Amazon and Walmart, which have the infrastructure already in place for these new privacy requirements.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462297"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a digital age, Canadians expect businesses to operate online and invest a certain amount of trust in the receiving end of a transaction to protect their personal information. They expect that it will be used only in ways that are necessary for a transaction to be completed, and nothing more.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462298"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exchange for convenience and expediency, consumers have been willing to compromise their anonymity to a degree, but they expect their government and businesses to match this free flow of information with appropriate safeguards. This is why Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>, and every other bill similar to it, must be carefully scrutinized.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462299"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of my colleagues have already indicated, this is a large and complex bill, and we believe that its individual components are too important for them to be considered as one part of an omnibus bill.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462300"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three‚Äî</div></span></div>

Over 90% of them are women and girls. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462307"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around the world, over 50 million people are trapped in modern-day slavery, many making the very products Canadians buy.

It destroys lives and families. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462308"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can change this. We can end this.

Immigration allows us to fill skill gaps in our economy, to incubate movements for freedom and justice, and to pollinate our national conversation with the good and beautiful from all over the world.

First and foremost, we would ensure that those who come to Canada can work in their fields. We would support programs to allow newcomers to qualify before they even get here, provide support for foreign-trained professionals to get certified and sign deals with provinces to guarantee that they would get a clear yes or no answer on their qualifications within 60 days.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462332"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Liberals, new Canadians are seeing red: red ink and red tape.

For new Canadians and all Canadians, it is blue skies ahead.</div></span></div>

They said that they plan to politicize charitable status determination, effectively denying charitable status to organizations that do not share the Liberal Party's views on abortion. This politicization of the charitable status would jeopardize the good work being done by hospitals, houses of worship, schools, homeless shelters and other charitable organizations that happen to have a different perspective from the Liberal Party on these issues.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462600"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would involve the application of another values test, similar to the Canada summer jobs program values test that was previously put in place by the government and roundly criticized. Petitioners note that all Canadians who are involved in charitable activities should not face discrimination on the basis of their deeply held personal convictions. Petitioners call on the House and the government to protect and preserve the application of charitable status rules on a politically and ideologically neutral basis without discrimination on the basis of political or religious values and without the imposition of a values test. Petitioners also want to see the government reaffirm the right to freedom of expression.</div></span></div>

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11955730">Mrs. Cathay Wagantall (Yorkton‚ÄîMelville, CPC)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, as many of my colleagues already indicated, this is a large and complex bill, and we believe that its individual components are too important for them to be considered as one part of an omnibus bill. I am pleased with the ruling of the Speaker.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462639"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three separate pieces of legislation to this bill. In part 1, the consumer privacy protection act would repeal and replace decades-old measures concerning personal information protection. In part 2, the personal information and data protection tribunal act would strike a tribunal to administer penalties for violations of the CPPA. In part 3, the artificial intelligence and data act is brand new to the bill and sets up a framework for design and use of AI in Canada, which is almost entirely unregulated.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462640"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long before the widespread use of the Internet, our Supreme Court was clear that privacy is at the heart of liberty in a modern state. The government should be taking every opportunity possible to enshrine privacy in our laws as essential to the exercise of our rights and freedoms in Canada. As Daniel Therrien stated in the Toronto Star earlier this month, ‚Äúdemocracies must adopt robust solutions anchored in values, not laws that pretend to protect citizens but preserve the conditions that created the digital Wild West.‚Äù</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462641"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of privacy should anchor the bill. Instead, the bill fails right out of the gate. The preamble states:</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462642"></a><div>
        <div>
          <div valign="top">
            <div width="30" align="right"></div>
<div><small>the protection of the privacy interests of individuals with respect to their personal information is essential to individual autonomy and dignity and to the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms in Canada</small></div>
</div>
</div>
</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462643"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing this value in the preamble of the bill where it has no teeth raises distrust rather than confidence that the government truly respects Canadians' privacy rights. The CPPA would require organizations, companies or government departments affected by the bill to develop their own codes of practice for the protection of personal information. While these codes must be approved and certified by the Privacy Commissioner, one can only imagine the variation of protection that would result. This requirement would add significant red tape and would be yet another onerous task borne on the backs of small and medium-sized businesses, which employ most Canadians. It would also create more work for the Privacy Commissioner in parsing through complicated codes created by larger, wealthier, powerful corporations, companies or government departments that have legal teams whose sole purpose is to find creative ways to perhaps game the system.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462644"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it would take more time and investment up front, the better option, in my mind, would be to create a standard code of practice that all entities have to follow. This could certainly be taken on as one of the first responsibilities of the expanded Office of the Privacy Commissioner in defining the universal code of practices, where confidence in the process would be greatest and where the greatest level of concern for individual privacy actually exists.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462645"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill states that personal information can be transferred without Canadians' consent for purposes ranging from research to analysis to business purposes, but it must be de-identified before this can take place. At first glance, this is a positive measure until it is compared with anonymization as an alternative. According to the bill, de-identify means ‚Äúto modify personal information so that an individual cannot be directly identified from it, though a risk of the individual being identified remains.‚Äù That leaves much to be desired when compared to the anonymization of personal information. In the bill, anonymize means ‚Äúto irreversibly and permanently modify personal information, in accordance with generally accepted best practices, to ensure that no individual can be identified from the information, whether directly or indirectly, by any means.‚Äù</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462646"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any attempt to identify individuals from de-identified information is prohibited, except in approved circumstances. While many of these approved circumstances relate to the ability of an entity to test the effectiveness of its de-identification system, the potential for abuse still exists. This bill would be improved by eliminating those chances for abuse. We should examine replacing de-identification with anonymization wherever possible.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462647"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparing Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> to the EU regulations, we see there are several ways in which the CPPA does not live up to what is widely considered to be the international gold standard of privacy protection, which is the European Union's 2016 General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. There is a glaring example of Bill C-27's inferior protections: The GDPR processes personal data in such a manner that it can no longer be attributed to a specific individual without the use of additional information kept separately, subject to technical and organizational measures. This is a security and privacy-by-design measure of the GDPR.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462648"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding what Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> considers to be sensitive information, there is nothing to indicate what sensitive information actually entails. It is also limited in its application. Only the personal information of minors is considered to be sensitive. All information Canadians surrender to any entity should be considered sensitive. On the other hand, the GDPR possesses a particular regime for special categories of personal data, including racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data and data concerning health, sex life and sexual orientation.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1540"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1540"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1545"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1545"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1535"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1535" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1540)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462649"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are happy to see that consent is better defined in Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>. However, exceptions for activities not requiring consent would remain in place. Some of them are so broad that an entity could interpret them as never requiring consent. These are loopholes that Canadians should not have to endure when they are required to check the box that they have read and accept terms before they are able to interact with a digital site.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462650"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, legitimate interests in a given situation may be used by companies to disregard consent. There is a danger that these interests will outweigh potential adverse effects on the individual. Attempting to define legitimate interests allows for too much interpretation, and interpretation is not something that lends itself to privacy laws. The use of personal information could also be exempt from consent if a reasonable person would expect the use of their information for business activities. There is no definition as to what a reasonable person is.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462651"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is that there are far too many loopholes and vague terms. For the savvy, wealthy or well-lawyered, the potential for abuse exists. The GDPR, conversely, is unequivocal on consent. It must be freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous and in an intelligible and accessible form, and is only valid for specific purposes. Canada should have followed that example. Canadians cannot help but wonder why Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> does not.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462652"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the proposed CPPA, there is no minimum age for minor consent, nor is ‚Äúminor‚Äù defined. In the EU, the GDPR sets out a minimum age for a minor's consent at 16 years of age. Member states also have the flexibility to allow for a lower age, provided the age is not below 13 years.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462653"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a breach of personal information does take place, Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> would make Canada slower to respond than its international counterparts. This bill mandates that a notification be made to the Privacy Commissioner of any breach that creates a real risk of significant harm as soon as it is feasible. The individual affected would also need to be informed, but, again, as soon as feasible.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462654"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GDPR sets out that a mandatory notification must be made to the supervisory authority without undue delay, or 72 hours after having become aware of the incident in certain circumstances. Prior to the introduction of this bill, Canada was lagging behind internationally, and it still is, even after. The GDPR is already six years old. That is six years of extra time during which the Liberals have failed to develop this legislation to meet the robust international standard.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462655"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>, the Privacy Commissioner would be empowered to investigate any certified organization for contravening the act. The commissioner has been rightly asking for increased powers and responsibilities for some time, and this goes beyond a mere recommendation to violators to stop their actions. The commissioner would be able to recommend greater penalties of no more than $20 million or 4% gross global revenue for a summary offence, and no more than $25 million or 5% gross global revenue for an indictable offence.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462656"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These penalties should add more bite to what the Privacy Commissioner can do and impact how Canadians‚Äô personal information will ultimately be treated. The penalties would also apply to a greater number of provisions, such as actions that contravene the establishment and implementation of a privacy management program and failure to ensure equivalent protection for personal information transferred to a service provider.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462657"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these new powers for the Privacy Commissioner hit a dead end when taken in context with the second part of this bill, which establishes a tribunal. The personal information and data protection tribunal would consist of no more than six members, and only half of those members must have experience in information and privacy law. The Privacy Commissioner would have order-making authority and the ability to make recommendations to this tribunal regarding penalties. However, the tribunal would have the power to apply its own decision instead, which would be final and binding. Except for judicial review under the Federal Courts Act, the tribunal's decisions would not be subject to appeal or to review by any court. These are powers equivalent to a superior court of record.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462658"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of this tribunal would dull the new teeth given to the Privacy Commissioner. While the commissioner could recommend that a penalty be levied for violations of the CPPA, it is the tribunal that would have the power to set the amount owed by these organizations.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1545"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1545"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1550"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1550"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1540"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1540" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1545)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462659"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cost associated with striking this tribunal is also a concern. Despite the fact that its work would likely be limited to a handful of times per year to determine penalties, it would apparently require a full-time and permanent staff of 20. I am deeply concerned as the government also has a bad habit of striking advisory councils, or so-called arm's-length regulatory bodies, in advance of bills being debated and passed in the House, long before the ink on the legislation is dry.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462660"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My memory is drawn to when a bill was being debated in the House, and I inquired about the details of the proposed environmental council. I was told with great zeal that it had already been established, and the members had been appointed before the bill was even debated in the House. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462661"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the current <a id="214296" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/214296/2022-11-28">Prime Minister</a> tell us if this tribunal would be struck only after Parliament has dealt fully with this bill? Will the Liberals be transparent with Canadians on how the appointment process would be undertaken? Can they assure Canadians that a full-time and permanent staff of 20 has not already been determined? After seven years of Liberal power, the level of patronage in this place run deep.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462662"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 2, which is the personal information and data protection tribunal act, should be removed as it is a bureaucratic middleman with power that would conflict and create redundancy with the Privacy Commissioner's new powers. The new powers would mean little if they were not coupled with quick and effective consequences for violators. It would prolong decisions on fines and harm Canada's reputation of holding violators accountable.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462663"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also not align with our friends in the EU, U.K., New Zealand and Australia that do not use a tribunal system for issuing fines. It goes to show Canadians that when it comes to making big government needlessly bigger, the Liberals do it well.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462664"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and final part of this bill is the only entirely new component. The artificial intelligence and data act seeks to regulate an entity, artificial intelligence, that has not been regulated before in this country.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462665"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would set standards for the creation and use of AI systems in Canada by both domestic and international entities. More specifically, international and interprovincial trade and commerce in artificial intelligence systems would be regulated through common requirements for the design and use of those systems. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462666"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would prohibit certain conduct pertaining to AI systems that could lead to harmful results for individuals and their personal data. There is that mention of personal data. This is a massive undertaking, attempting to regulate something that, up to this point, has been almost entirely unregulated.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462667"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also understand that consultations on this were only initiated in June. Logic would dictate that such a bill requires careful scrutiny and time to get it right. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462668"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Requiring record keeping and human oversight are positive developments. What we find difficulty with is getting a clear picture of what the final framework would look like, as the minister alone would be empowered to establish these regulations. The minister would be able to act independently of Parliament in making rulings and imposing fines. In an age of uncertainty and new horizons for our relationship with AI, this is unacceptable. Parliament, at the very least, and independent experts and watchdogs should be central to the creation and enforcement of these rules.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1550"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1555"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1555"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1545"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1545" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1550)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462669"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that once again the government has chosen to simply tack on a crucial area of concern to Canadians to an already complicated bill, and it wishes to again entrust sweeping powers to a minister to act independently of parliamentary oversight.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462670"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My final thoughts today on Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> are as follows. The Conservatives are considering this bill through a reasoned approach, and appreciate that stakeholders who have been calling for this legislation for years are watching today's debate closely. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462671"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is absolutely clear that modern-day protection for the personal information of Canadians is required. They must have the ability to access and control its collection, use, monitoring and disclosure, and the right to delete it or the right to vanish. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462672"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we ensure that data is protected through watertight regulations and strict fines for abuse while also realizing that not every business affected by this bill would have the resources of Walmart or Amazon? Small and medium-sized businesses should be shielded from onerous regulation that stifles their growth. This is not to say that business interests should weigh equally with personal privacy, but there is a balance to be had, and I believe the Liberals do not have it right here.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462673"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in a cynical attempt to move their legislative agenda forward, the Liberals have bundled changes to privacy laws with a first-of-its-kind framework for artificial intelligence that once again intends to govern through top-down regulation and not through legislation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462674"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals should commit today to splitting this bill up to allow Canadians a clear view of its intended impact. With that commitment, the Conservatives will be looking to do the hard work at committee to improve the long-awaited but flawed elements of this legislation. Even in an age of convenience, the world in which we live grows even more complicated by the day. Canadians deserve privacy protection worthy of 2022 realities and beyond.</div></span></div>

Even though we are living in this complex technological era, the current privacy law was last updated over 20 years ago, before smart phones or any social media platforms even existed. This brings us to the cardinal step our government is taking today. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462703"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know Canadians need to have confidence not only that their is data safe and their privacy fully respected, but also that their government is striving to enhance the protection of their privacy through the implementation of timely safeguards in an era when the digital economy is driving transformative change. These objectives are exactly what the privacy protection framework of Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> would aim to accomplish. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462704"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are introducing new legislation to ensure our country has critical protection in place to safeguard the security of Canadians. This legislation proposes not only to increase the confidence of Canadians in emerging technologies but also to strengthen privacy protection for consumers while supporting economic development that results from the responsible use of data and artificial intelligence. It would also pave the path for governing trade and commerce in the private sector, as it relates to regulating how private organizations handle personal information and develop AI systems.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462705"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon enactment into law, Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> would be one of the most substantial improvements to Canadian privacy laws in decades, but it would go further by establishing a legal framework to regulate high-impact AI systems to better protect consumers. In essence, this legislation proposes the following key enactments: the consumer privacy protection act; the personal information and data protection tribunal act; and finally, the artificial intelligence and data act, or AIDA. I will expand on each one of these major enactments in detail.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462706"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enactment of the consumer privacy protection act proposes to achieve the following: first, to enhance Canadians' control over personal information by empowering them to request its deletion, and adding new transparency requirements for organizations when obtaining consent from individuals for their information; second, to create new data mobility rights that promote consumer choice and innovation; and third, to bolster our privacy enforcement and oversight by granting the Privacy Commissioner of Canada order-making powers to compel organizations to stop the use of personal information, through administrative monitoring penalties for serious breaches of law.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462707"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This aspect of the bill is of the utmost importance to nearly 200 of my constituents in the riding of Richmond Hill who have voiced their pertinent concerns regarding privacy protection and have spoken to me personally in relation to this legislation and what it seeks to achieve for Canadians. Through the mentioned key facets, my constituents, and in fact all Canadians, can rest assured that their government's sole intention is to ensure Canadians' first-class privacy and data protection.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462708"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By enacting the personal information and data protection tribunal act, our government seeks to strengthen protection for minors' personal information, introduce greater flexibility for the Privacy Commissioner and explicitly foster more privacy expertise among key decision-makers. This would be achieved through the establishment of a new administrative tribunal to hear appeals of certain decisions made by the Privacy Commissioner.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1610"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1615"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1615"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1605"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1605" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1610)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462709"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third and most crucial aspect of this legislation, in my point of view, would establish a new law on artificial intelligence.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462710"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a recent study by Nanos Research on behalf of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, key industry stakeholders have expressed a range of concerns regarding artificial intelligence. As technologies have matured, risks associated with AI systems have also come to light, including with respect to health, safety and bias. These concerns speak to the need to ensure the responsible development of AI. Moreover, as companies invest in increasingly complex AI systems, Canadians need to have confidence in AI systems they use every day.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462711"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore essential that the use and collection of data follow best practices to protect the rights and freedoms of Canadians. This brings me to the very reason why I personally identify this enactment as the most crucial aspect of this legislation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462712"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in response to these legitimate concerns that our government proposes to introduce a new law to promote a unique approach to AI. It is an approach that would protect Canadians from discrimination, loss of autonomy and serious harm to their health, safety and economic well-being. The newly proposed AI law contains central provisions that would protect commercially sensitive information while ensuring that AI systems do not cause adverse effects on Canadians. Consequently, this approach would establish rules aimed at promoting good data-governance practices and respect for Canadian standards and values.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462713"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This new law would support responsible innovation by giving companies a clear framework for developing AI systems; compel organizations responsible for AI systems to mitigate potential harm to Canadians, including bias; establish an AI and data commissioner to support the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry in the administration of the act to encourage innovation in the marketplace; and, finally, impose serious penalties for all use of illegally obtained personal information.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462714"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also notable to mention that it would serve as a build-up on our government's previous investments and commitment to expanding the pan-Canadian AI strategy first launched in 2017 to enhance growth in Canada's digital economy.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462715"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these acts would work to provide Canadians with more autonomy over their privacy and increase accountability of personal information handled by organizations, while also giving Canadians the freedom to move their information from one organization to another in a secure manner.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462716"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In quick summary, by introducing this groundbreaking piece of legislation, our government is working to strengthen and modernize our privacy laws and to protect Canadian consumers by limiting private companies' abilities to access private information in the digital sector. Most importantly, we would be creating new rules for the responsible development of Al alongside the continuation of the advancement of its implementation across Canada.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462717"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The digital charter implementation act would ensure Canadians have strong privacy protections and clear rules of the road for businesses, as well as guardrails to govern the responsible use of artificial intelligence. As I stand here today in support of this important piece of legislation, I am confident that, given our country's highly skilled workforce, with this vital step, Canada would be well positioned not only to play an important global role in the field of AI, but also to create an environment where Canadian companies could be world leaders in responsible innovations.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462718"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, through this cardinal legislation, Canadians would be reassured that we would never compromise on trust and safety for their privacy, and that their government is wholeheartedly committed to advancing Canadian privacy protection laws while unlocking innovation that promotes a strong economy that works for everyone.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462719"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to close this intervention by encouraging all my colleagues in the House to support this valuable piece of legislation. We can work together to move beyond traditional privacy protection to ensure data control for all Canadians and modernize our laws to adapt to the realities of a complex digital economy. This is the only way to advance Canadian digital technology and Canadian values across the world.</div></span></div>

More specifically, I would like to discuss the new artificial intelligence and data act. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462735"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation seeks to not only enhance Canadians' confidence in emerging technologies, but also support economic development stemming from the responsible use of AI systems and data.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462736"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many have noted, Canada is well placed to play an important global role in AI. Thanks to Canada's highly skilled and diverse workforce and experts at research centres across the country, we have a unique opportunity to create an environment where Canadian companies can be world leaders in responsible innovation, taking full advantage of the digital economy. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462737"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pan-Canadian institutes such as the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, or Mila, the Vector Institute in Toronto, and the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute in Edmonton reflect the abundance of Canadian talent and resources. What is more, according to Global Advantage, in January 2020, the number of AI companies in Canada, in other words, companies with a product or service that implements AI, has doubled over the past five years to 660.</div></span><p class="floorlanguage">[<i>English</i>]</p><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462738"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsible use of data and AI systems has the potential to drive improvements in all sectors of the economy, leading to groundbreaking discoveries with significant economic, health, environmental and social benefits, including streamlining processes and decision-making, eliminating inefficiencies and enabling better resource allocation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462739"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI is already augmenting processes and skills in every industry. As noted in the March 2021 report, ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence Policy and Funding in Canada‚Äù, by McGill University's Centre for Interdisciplinary Research on Montreal, the Government of Canada is making massive investments in AI, with $1 billion in government contributions provided across Canada as of August 2020. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462740"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, in budget 2021 the Government of Canada committed to expanding the pan-Canadian AI strategy that was first launched in 2017 with an initial investment of $125 million through the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Budget 2021 proposes additional funding of $443.8 million over 10 years, starting in 2021‚Äì22. It is clear that the government recognizes the potential of this industry and that the development of artificial intelligence technologies will play a fundamental role in the growth of the digital economy. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462741"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are also optimistic about the future benefits of AI. For example, a recent study by Nanos Research on behalf of ISED shows that Canadians are almost seven times more likely to say that the impact of AI will be very positive rather than very unfavourable. However, stakeholders have also expressed a range of concerns regarding AI and automated decision-making systems. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462742"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As some of these technologies have matured, risks associated with AI systems have also come to light, including with respect to health, safety and bias. The same Nanos survey I mentioned earlier noted that Canadians are most concerned about job loss, AI replacing humans, privacy and security, AI malfunction, and biased decision-making and ethics considerations. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462743"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These concerns speak to the need to ensure the responsible development of AI. The proposed consumer privacy protection act will address protections related to privacy and related security elements, but what about health, safety and bias? As machines learn from datasets they are fed, they may replicate many of the past failings that resulted in systematic disparate treatment of minorities and other marginalized consumers in vital sectors such as banking, housing and health care. </div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1625"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1630"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1630"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1620"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1620" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1625)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Quebec has a law that protects its citizens' privacy, law 25. We talked about it earlier. In the early 2000s, PIPEDA's paragraph 26(2)(<i>b</i>) stated that the Governor in Council would, by order, respect Quebec's legislation. Essentially, the federal act would not apply with respect to personal information about individuals' property or their civil rights. In other words, the act would leave matters under Quebec's jurisdiction alone. Even though Quebec's law 25 already complies with EU expectations, Bill¬†<a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C‚Äë27</a> contains no clause guaranteeing that the federal government will respect the application of Quebec's law.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462757"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is simple.

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11956531">Mr. James Bezan (Selkirk‚ÄîInterlake‚ÄîEastman, CPC)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure to rise to discuss Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>, an act to enact the consumer privacy protection act, the personal information and data protection tribunal act and the artificial intelligence and data act. There is a lot happening in Bill C-27. I have a lot of concerns about this bill, and that is why I will be voting against Bill C-27. It would not do the things we need to do to protect the privacy of Canadians.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462770"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would first flag, in looking at this legislation, that the first act it would create is the consumer privacy protection act. Why is it not the Canadians' privacy protection act? Why are we talking about consumers and giving more ability to corporations to collect the privacy data of Canadians? That, to me, is very disconcerting and one of the things I want to talk about during my presentation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462771"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, PIPEDA, was the very first piece of legislation we had back in 2000, so it has been 22 years since we have updated legislation related to the issue of the privacy protection of data that has been shared online. Of course, technology has evolved significantly over the last 20 years. If we look at PIPEDA, it all rolls back to 34 years ago when the Supreme Court of Canada said, ‚Äúthat privacy is...the heart of liberty in a modern state‚Äù. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462772"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It said ‚Äúprivacy is...the heart of liberty‚Äù, and that completely falls back on the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Concerning fundamental freedoms, subsection 2(b) of the charter says, ‚Äúfreedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication‚Äù while subsection 2(d) refers to, ‚Äúfreedom of association.‚Äù </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462773"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know very well that people's privacy has to be protected on anything they do online, what they do through mobile apps, what they do in their email communications and the collection of that data by service providers because, ultimately, anything we do online goes through a service provider on the Internet, and we have to ensure that our charter freedoms are protected to ensure our liberty.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462774"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already know that under freedom of association, a lot of people who gather in Facebook groups and other fora on the Internet have already been violated by the Emergencies Act. We know that during the ‚Äúfreedom convoy‚Äù in the city, the government was harvesting data and that data was then shared by some means. With GiveSendGo, the data was mined off of it, shared on Google Maps and distributed across the country. People's individual financial information, the ultimate piece of privacy that should be protected, went across this country and the government failed to intervene. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462775"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> falls short on what needs to happen to protect privacy, recognizing how people are using the Internet and modern technologies, especially with mobile apps and everything that is happening on our phones. However, the protection of individuals is worth it and the privacy rights are worthy of constitutional protection, which Bill C-27 fails to recognize. We do not have a definition of privacy rights or a guarantee of privacy rights in Bill C-27, and that is why it fails.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462776"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the shadow minister of national defence, but earlier this year I served for a number of months as the shadow minister of ethics and digital information. I can say that, during my time serving on the ethics committee, it dealt with a number of issues. One of them, of course, was the use of Clearview AI, the facial recognition software that the RCMP and other police agencies use across this country. The ethics committee dug in deep and provided a report.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462777"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals let the RCMP make use of this technology under their tenure and did not say anything until it became public. Clearview AI, an American company, was scraping images off of Facebook and other social media such as Instagram to populate its database. </div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1640"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1640"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1645"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1645"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1635"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1635" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1640)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462778"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That information was then used, using artificial intelligence, to profile and identify people using mass surveillance techniques. We found through testimony that, not only was this done illegally, and the Privacy Commissioner ruled that Clearview AI had broken the law and that the RCMP had used it illegally, but also it was racially discriminatory as well, and it was a huge problem that people of colour and women were unfairly treated by this AI.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462779"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> would not regulate the use of facial recognition technology such as Clearview AI. Right now, we know the RCMP disagrees with the ruling of the Privacy Commissioner, so the question is whether CSIS, the Department of National Defence or the Communications Security Establishment are making use of similar types of technology. I will get into some of the recommendations from that report if I have time later on, but we did call as a committee, and it was adopted by the majority of members on our committee, for a federal moratorium on the use of facial recognition technology. We called for new laws, guardrails and safeguards to be built into legislation through PIPEDA and through the Privacy Act.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462780"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> would not provide that protection to Canadians. It would not ban or install a moratorium on the use of FRT, so that is absent.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462781"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we asked that all companies be prohibited from scraping the images of Canadians off the Internet, whether it be through Facebook, Instagram, TikTok or whatever the app might be. We know that this causes potential harm to Canadians, yet Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> fails again to recognize this harm. The Liberals failed to incorporate recommendations coming from a standing committee of the House into this legislation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462782"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other things we heard about was that Tim Hortons was caught mass tracking Canadians who were using their app. If anyone who had the Tim Hortons app went to a Tim Hortons location and bought a coffee and a donut, that app was then used to track the behaviours of consumers of Tim Hortons as they were travelling for the next 30 minutes.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462783"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, this shows how the sharing of personal information and the mass data violation with the tracking of individual Canadians violated their privacy rights. Although Tim Hortons assures us they are not doing it now, we are not sure what happened with that data. Was it shared or sold to other corporations? Again, Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> would give companies, under clause 55 of the bill, a litany of exceptions to consent to sharing that personal information they collected through the use of their app. That would violate our privacy rights.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462784"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Liberals have built in here words about consent and the ability for individuals to write in with consent or get removed, when it comes to terms and conditions, most Canadians, when they download an app and check the box to say ‚Äúyes‚Äù, they have not read those terms and conditions. They do not know that some of these apps, as Tim Hortons was doing, were actually undermining their own privacy rights as they apply to the use of mobility data information, and because those terms and conditions are long, legalistic and cumbersome, people refuse to actually take the time to read it. Just because someone checks the box to say ‚ÄúYes, I consent to using this app‚Äù, does not give those companies the right to violate the privacy of those individuals' outside of the commercial transaction that takes place between them and, in this situation, Tim Hortons.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462785"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exemptions that are allowed under the bill for corporations need to be changed in the bill. There is no we can support it as Conservatives because they would be huge violation of privacy and of mobility, which are all things that are provided under our charter rights.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1645"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1645"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1650"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1650"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1640"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1640" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1645)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462786"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the government, we also saw the Liberal <a id="278906" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/278906/2022-11-28">Minister of Health</a> stand up and defend the Public Health Agency of Canada, which was caught red-handed having companies such as TELUS track the movement of Canadians via their cellphones. It said that it de-identified all the data it collected, but it wanted to know how Canadians were moving around the country underneath the auspices of the COVID pandemic and how transmission was occurring. That was a violation of privacy. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462787"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At committee, we made a bunch of recommendations, which the government has failed to implement in Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>. Bill C-27 gives companies, such as TELUS and other mobile service providers, the ability to track the movement of Canadians across this country. It may want to call it ‚Äúmeta data‚Äù or say it has been de-identified, but we also know from testimony at committee that it can re-identify the meta data that has been turned over to the government. We have to make sure that it is done in the public interest and under the auspices of national security, public health and national defence. If that type of data is being collected, then there has to be a way to dump that data and ensure it disappears forever.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462788"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the other studies we undertook was of the Pegasus software system, which is very insidious. It is being used for national security. A similar type of technology is being used right now by the RCMP, CSIS and others. It has the ability to turn people's cellphones into video cameras and listening devices. It is a very cryptic, insidious spyware, or malware, that people can get on their phones by accidentally clicking on a piece of information, like opening up an email, and it will download. Then they can listen to the individuals in that place. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462789"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not have to bug people's houses anymore. They do not have to use high-grade technology to listen to the interests of individuals because it gives them the ability to turn cameras on to watch what they are doing, and turn microphones on to hear what they are discussing without them ever knowing it.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462790"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to make sure charter rights are protected. There are times we have to use this in the collection of data. There was definitely the admission by members of the RCMP that they have used it over a dozen times. They have their own system, not Pegasus, but one similar to it. We know that to use that type of technology, to protect the rights of Canadians, there should be a warrant issued to ensure there is judicial oversight, even if it is being used by the Department of National Defence and CSE, we have to make sure it is not being used against Canadians and only deals with those national threats they refer to as threats that are foreign entities. That is something that Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> fails to recognize.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462791"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say this as well. We heard at committee that this type of technology is being used against politicians, that there is foreign interference out there. As we have come to learn on different occasions, there are countries out there and other agencies that are interested in what we are saying as politicians, not just here in the House, but the private conversations we have in caucus, among colleagues, when we get together at committees, at pre‚Äìcommittee meetings, and the discussions we have in our offices. Our phones have become listening devices, so we have to be aware of that.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462792"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things we have always talked about is what the gold level standard is to protect individuals, the citizens of our country, and to ensure their privacy rights are paramount in all the discussions we have. At the same time, we know there are going to be advances in technology, and the need at times to have police agencies, the Department of National Defence and the military use technology that could violate the rights of some people, but always with that judicial oversight that is provided underneath the charter. That gold standard is the European Union‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation. We see that the gold standard goes well above and beyond what Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> is trying to do.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1650"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1650"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1655"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1655"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1645"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1645" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1650)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462793"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> falls way short. We heard at committee that with the data collection taking place on apps, online surveillance measures have to provide the right for data to be forgotten, or the right to data disposal or erasure, another terminology that is used. It is about making sure that data collected, even if it is for the public good or even if it is metadata, is disposed of at the end of the day.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462794"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should not be that I consent to have my data removed from a database by checking something off or having to write in an app being used to buy coffee at the neighbourhood store, for example. It should be that it is our right to be forgotten and that after a certain time frame, data is erased forever from the database where it is being held and is not used again for commercial purposes, nor used, sold or traded among commercial entities.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462795"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gold standard that the European Union has is not included in Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>. Again, that is why we have so many concerns.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462796"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at clause 55, which has already been mentioned by a number of my colleagues, it has a boatload of exemptions built in for corporations to get around the removal of privacy data. These exemptions allow them to write in, make changes and share data. We have to make sure the onus is not on Canadians to get their privacy information back or to get their privacy information removed. The onus should be on corporations to prove why they need it. The onus also has to be on the government. This is about transparency and accountability. There needs to be a realization that Canadians deserve an explanation as to why some of their data may be used, even if it is de-identified, and why it would be used for the buildup of public policy or to deal with issues like a pandemic.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462797"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to move forward a bit, I note that given some of things we saw at committee when we were looking at facial recognition technology, the power of artificial intelligence and the growing power of AI, we made a number of recommendations. They included that whenever the government looks at using artificial intelligence or FRT for military, defence or public safety, it needs to be referred to the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians for study, review and recommendation, and it needs to be reported publicly. There also needs to be a public artificial intelligence registry for the algorithmic tools being used. However, we do not see that registry for artificial intelligence companies in Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462798"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already talked about the right to be forgotten and said there needs to be a set period of time. I have talked about the prohibition on the practice of capturing images of Canadians from public platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. We also need to make sure there is a federal moratorium on using FRT until we have proven it is needed by police agencies, the justice system has proven that it works and we are sure it is not racializing Canadians in its use. Ultimately, the Privacy Commissioner and judicial authorization have to override that.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462799"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Daniel Therrien, the Privacy Commissioner, said about the RCMP:</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462800"></a><div>
        <div>
          <div valign="top">
            <div width="15" align="right"></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>[It] did not take measures to verify the legality of Clearview‚Äôs collection of personal information, and lacked any system to ensure that new technologies were deployed lawfully. Ultimately, we determined the RCMP‚Äôs use of Clearview to be unlawful, since it relied on the illegal collection and use of facial images by its business partner.</small></div>
</div>
</div>
</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462801"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its business partner was Clearview AI.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462802"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an ongoing need to ensure that charter rights and international human rights are brought together in a collaborative way in how we all form our opinions on Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>. I hope the bill is taken back and redrafted, and if not, I hope there is an opportunity to make massive amendments to it so that it actually takes into consideration the privacy rights of all Canadians.</div></span></div>

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11956960">Mr. Andy Fillmore (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Lib.)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for <a id="278722" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/278722/2022-11-28">Saanich‚ÄîGulf Islands</a>.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462831"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to be here to discuss Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>, the digital charter implementation act of 2022. The bill would implement a new world-class regime for the protection of consumers and to ensure that Canadians have confidence that businesses are handling their personal data responsibly and are developing and deploying new technologies in a responsible and ethical way.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462832"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also includes important changes that would support responsible innovation in an increasingly digital and data-driven marketplace. It would modernize Canada's regulatory framework for privacy protection in the private sector in a manner that supports innovation and is interoperable with the data protection laws of Canada's major trading partners.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462833"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also reinforce Canada's commitment to responsible artificial intelligence development, or AI development. As parliamentary secretary to the <a id="271243" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/271243/2022-11-28">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</a>, and indeed as the MP for Halifax, with its burgeoning tech sector, I can tell members from first-hand experience that Canada is a world leader in AI, with top talent and innovative companies.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462834"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a world that is increasingly reliant on digital technologies, the bill would build on Canada's advantage by creating a foundation of trust and ensuring that companies meet the highest standards of responsibility when developing and deploying AI. We need to ensure that Canadians‚Äô personal information is protected, but there is also a need to support Canadian businesses so that they can grow, prosper and innovate in this increasingly digital world.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462835"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize that technology is growing rapidly and providing companies with large amounts of personal information. This information fuels business decisions. It informs the creation of new products and services for customers. This innovation is critical, but we absolutely have to ensure that this innovation happens in a responsible way.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462836"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in my limited time today, I am going to focus my comments on the first and third parts of the act, with a focus on enabling and supporting responsible innovation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462837"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin with the first part.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462838"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed new Consumer Privacy Protection Act, or CPPA, retains the principles-based approach of our current private sector privacy law in order to continue harnessing the success of a flexible and adaptable privacy law.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462839"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know circumstances are changing all the time. To better reflect advances in digital technologies, the emergence of AI and other new technologies, the CPPA contains a number of provisions to support industry innovation without compromising the protections Canadians depend on.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462840"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the CPPA includes a new exception to consent, to cover specified business activities, and it introduces the concept of legitimate interests into Canada‚Äôs privacy framework, with updates that take into consideration what we have heard from stakeholders on the previous proposal that came before Parliament in 2020, back when I was parliamentary secretary to the then minister of heritage and we were considering this.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462841"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective is to help reduce the administrative burden on businesses and on individuals in situations in which seeking consent is not meaningful, for example, the use of personal information for the shipping of goods that have been requested by the individual.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462842"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In these situations, the customer clearly anticipates receiving a shipment, and the company should be able to undertake this shipment without the law adding an extra burden to provide this service. Importantly, this exception may not be used in situations in which the organization intends to influence the individual‚Äôs behaviour or decisions.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462843"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, given the need to consider interests and potential impacts on individuals, the organization will be required to assess the potential impacts on individuals, implement measures to eliminate or mitigate such impacts, and comply with any prescribed requirements. The Privacy Commissioner may review such assessments on request. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462844"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, the inclusion of a targeted legitimate interest exception aligns the CPPA with international best practices, including those of the EU.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462845"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the CPPA defines and clarifies how businesses should handle de-identified personal information, in other words, personal information that has been modified to reduce the risk that an individual could be recognized or identified.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462846"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This framework takes into account the feedback we heard from the previous proposal. The bill also defines anonymized information and confirms that information that has no risk of identifying an individual falls outside the scope of the act.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462847"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us today would incentivize organizations to de-identify personal information before using it for research, development and analysis purposes, further protecting Canadians‚Äô privacy.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1710"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1715"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1715"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1705"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1705" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1710)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462848"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know businesses need to invest in R and D to improve their products, which benefits customers by providing them with new and innovative products and services. This provision would allow businesses the flexibility to use de-identified data for R and D, adding value for both customers and firms. However, the CPPA confirms that this information would still stay within the protection of the act and under the oversight of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, as one would expect.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462849"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent years have also shown the critical role data plays in developing evidence-based policies and responding to public crises. Whether it is to respond to public health needs or the now-present challenges from climate change, or even planning a city, data is needed to help us rise to these challenges, but it must be used responsibly and in keeping with our values. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462850"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the CPPA introduces a framework that would allow for the use of data in ways that would benefit the public good. It would do this by allowing companies to disclose de-identified data to specified public entities, such as hospitals, universities and libraries. These disclosures would be permitted only where specific criteria are satisfied. That is, the personal information must not identify an individual, and there must be a socially beneficial purpose, like those related to health, public infrastructure or environmental protections. This would ensure that the privacy of individuals is protected, while making sure we would be using everything at our disposal to respond to increasingly challenging global issues.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462851"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the CPPA introduces a new framework for codes of practice and certification systems that would enable businesses to proactively demonstrate their compliance with the law. For example, companies that are engaged in a particular business activity could collaborate on the development of a code of practice that outlines how they comply with the specific provisions of the law. With the approval of that code by the Privacy Commissioner, organizations would have greater certainty that they are meeting their obligations. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462852"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the bill provides a scheme for recognizing certification systems that demonstrate compliance with the law. Organizations that choose to participate in approved certification schemes would benefit from a reduced risk of enforcement actions under the act. This would be especially helpful for small- and medium-sized entities that do not necessarily have extensive legal resources at their fingertips. These new frameworks for recognized codes and certifications would make it easier for businesses to demonstrate their compliance with the law to customers, to business partners and to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462853"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to move now to the third part of the legislation, the proposed artificial intelligence and data act, or AIDA, which would support responsible innovation by giving businesses a clear framework to guide the design, development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems, or AI systems. AI systems have many benefits and operate across national and provincial boundaries. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462854"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, Canada has become a global leader in artificial intelligence through the pan-Canadian AI strategy. However, as the technology has matured, risks associated with AI systems have also come to light, including with respect to health, safety and bias. In order for Canadian innovators to maintain this status, common standards are needed for international and interprovincial trade in AI systems. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462855"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would guide innovation by building confidence in the technology and protecting Canadians against the harms such systems can cause. Specifically, AIDA would ensure that entities responsible for high-impact AI systems identify and mitigate potential harms, including bias. By aligning with internationally recognized standards, this would ensure market access for Canadian innovations. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462856"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, an artificial intelligence and data commissioner would be created, with the dual role of support the minister in administering the act and playing a supportive role in helping businesses understand their responsibilities and how to comply. We believe the government is paving the way for Canada to be a world leader in innovation by providing Canadians with clear rules on how it may be developed and used. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462857"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is imperative the House move to pass this bill. The digital charter implementation act would not only protect the personal information of Canadians and lay the ground rules for the responsible design, development, deployment and operation of AI systems in Canada, but also enable the responsible innovation that will promote a strong Canadian economy. With this bill, the government is sending a clear message that responsible innovation is critical for Canada‚Äôs future economic success and competitiveness. </div></span></div>

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11957949">Ms. Elizabeth May (Saanich‚ÄîGulf Islands, GP)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Madam Speaker, I acknowledge that I am standing today, as any day that I am on Parliament Hill, on the Algonquin land of the Anishinabe peoples. I say a large <i>meegwetch</i> to them.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462878"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am speaking today, as we all are, to Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>, which is really three bills in one. My other parliamentary colleagues have already canvassed the bare outline of this, in that we are looking at three bills: an act to create a consumer privacy protection act; a personal information and data protection tribunal act, which largely replaces some of what there was already in PIPEDA in the past; and a brand new artificial intelligence and data act.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462879"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to start with the artificial intelligence and data act because it is the part with which all of us are least familiar. Much of what we see in this bill was previously before Parliament in last session's Bill <a id="10950130" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/10950130">C-11</a>. There is a lot to dig into and understand here.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462880"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was reading through the whole concept of what kinds of harms are done by artificial intelligence, I found myself thinking back to a novel that came out in 1949. The kind of technology described in George Orwell's book, famously called <i>1984</i>, was unthinkable then. The dystopian visions of great writers like George Orwell or Margaret Atwood are hard to imagine. I will never forget the scene in the opening of <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i>, where a woman goes into a store and her debit card is taken from her. At that moment, we did not have debit cards. Margaret Atwood had to describe this futuristic concept of a piece of plastic that gave us access to our banks without using cash. No one had heard of it then.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462881"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are words from George Orwell, written in 1949, about the ways in which artificial intelligence and new technologies could really cause harm in a dystopian sense. In <i>1984</i>, he writes, ‚ÄúIt was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen. The smallest thing could give you away.‚Äù</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462882"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently, there is the song by <i>The Police</i> and written by Sting and others. I will never forget that once I went to a session on rights to privacy being under assault and a British jurist brought with him for his opening of the speech, ‚ÄúEvery breath you take, And every move you make, Every bond you break, Every step you take, I'll be watching you.‚Äù</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462883"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in a time when artificial intelligence can be enormously invasive of our privacy with things like visual recognition systems, as the hon. member for <a id="278158" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/278158/2022-11-28">Selkirk‚ÄîInterlake‚ÄîEastman</a> was just speaking to. These are things that, for someone like me born in 1954, are all rather new, but they are new for people born in 1990 too. It is very new technology and bringing in legislation to control it is equally new and challenging for us as parliamentarians. The whole notion that we are going to be able to spot the ways in which artificial intelligence can affect our democracy is something that will take time.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462884"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk about harms from this kind of technology, from capturing algorithms, from invading our spaces. We do not have to look any farther than the way Cambridge Analytica was used by the Brexit forces in the U.K. to harness a public outrage against something based on a pile of disinformation, by targeting individuals and collecting their data. That kind of Cambridge Analytica concern also gets into part 1 and part 2 of this bill. We really do need to figure out how to control the digital tech giants harvesting our information.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462885"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example used earlier today in debate, there is the idea that big digital giants and large corporations can profit from data without the consent of Canadians who may have put a family photo on social media, never knowing that their privacy has been invaded and their personal information and photos have been used for profit without their permission. In this sense, I am going to flag that in the context of the artificial intelligence and data act, I hope we will be taking the time necessary to hear witnesses specifically on this.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462886"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have developed a pattern in recent years, which is to say the last decade or so, of having three or four witnesses appear on panels. All of us in this place know that committees are trying to hear from a lot of people and receive a lot of evidence. It will do us a disservice in our dive into the artificial intelligence and data act if we combine panels of people who are experts on PIPEDA and people who are experts on other aspects of this bill, with panels on artificial intelligence and data. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462887"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committees that study this bill will control their own process. Committees are the masters of their own process, but I would urge the government, the Liberal legislative managers of this piece of legislation, Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>, to follow the lead of the Speaker's ruling earlier today. If we are going to vote on the artificial intelligence act as a separate piece when we come to vote, we could at least make an effort to ensure that the concentrated effort of committee members and hearing witness testimony is not diluted through several different pieces of legislation and panels with three or four witnesses. </div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1725"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1730"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1730"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1720"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1720" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1725)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462888"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members' questions will inevitably and invariably go to one or two. In this format of panels and pushing witnesses through quickly, we lose a lot of content. Compared with when I worked in government back in the 1980s, which I know seems like the dark ages and no one in this room was on committees in those days, committees would hear from a witness who could speak for 15 minutes and then we would have the rest of an hour to ask that one witness questions. Now that we are into something as complicated as this area, I would urge the committee to give it that kind of attention or to ask the government to send part 3, the artificial intelligence and data act, to a different committee, so that the study can be thorough and we can educate ourselves as to the unintended consequences that will inevitably occur if we go too fast.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462889"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the parts of the bill that deal with privacy, I want to put on the record again a question that was raised just moments ago about whether privacy legislation should apply to political parties in Canada. At the moment, it does not. Political parties are exempted from the kinds of privacy protections that other organizations, NGOs and corporations must use to protect the privacy information of their customers, consumers and citizens.</div></span><p class="floorlanguage">[<i>Translation</i>]</p><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462890"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Green Party of Canada believes it is essential that political parties be added to the list of organizations that have an obligation to protect the privacy of Canadians.</div></span><p class="floorlanguage">[<i>English</i>]</p><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462891"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will say quickly that I tend to agree with the first analysis of one of the NGOs that are very concerned with privacy information. OpenMedia, in an article by Brian Stewart, says very clearly that this legislation could actually make things worse for some privacy protections. They give the efforts of Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>'s consumer privacy protection act and its personal information and data protection tribunal act a grade of D. In other words, it passes but just barely. There will be many witnesses.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462892"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can certainly confirm that, as a Green Party member of Parliament in this place, I will be bringing amendments forward, assuming this bill gets through second reading, which I think we can assume, and ends up at committee.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462893"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the time remaining, I want to emphasize that Canada is aware that privacy is a fundamental human right. It is part of the UN declaration on the rights of individuals. I echo some of the sentiments from the hon. member for <a id="278158" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/278158/2022-11-28">Selkirk‚ÄîInterlake‚ÄîEastman</a> in asking why we are looking at consumer privacy. Maybe we should change that word to Canadians' rights and privacy.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462894"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also agree with many members who have spoken today about the problems of subclause 18(3) and the number of exemptions along with the question of what is a ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù reason that people's privacy can be invaded. That should be further clarified. I find ‚Äúa reasonable person would expect the collection or use for such an activity‚Äù to be fine, but the exemptions seem overly broad.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462895"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I dive into anything else I will go over my allotted time.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462896"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is important legislation. We must protect the privacy of Canadians. I think we will call on all parties in this place to set aside partisanship and make an honest effort to review it. That is not to delay it but to make an honest effort to review the bill before it leaves this place.</div></span></div>

I have agreed in this place before that, if an app is tracking personal information, whether it is a Tim Hortons or, worse, the government, we need to pay close attention to that. I think the legislation would make positive steps forward to prevent that, but I do not think we can say with confidence that the legislation absolutely would ensure it never happens again.</div></span></div>

As written, the bill has some grey areas, some things the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois has reservations about, but we do think it has a lot of potential.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462916"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill¬†<a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C‚Äë27</a> enacts the consumer privacy protection act. Sponsored by the <a id="271243" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/271243/2022-11-28">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</a>, the member for Saint-Maurice‚ÄîChamplain, the bill is at second reading. It would create three different acts: the consumer privacy protection act, the personal information and data protection tribunal act, and the artificial intelligence and data act. That last one is very interesting.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462917"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, Bill¬†C‚Äë27 seeks to strengthen the protection of anonymity and privacy. Now that digital technology is omnipresent in our lives, it is harder than ever to make sure our privacy and personal information are protected.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462918"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until now, organizations of every kind have taken advantage of the absence of a legal consumer protection framework. In Canada, personal information is a commodity without a legal owner.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462919"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just look at the Cambridge Analytica scandal during the 2016 U.S. election. Bill C‚Äë27 aims to change this sorry state of affairs, which is threatening our democracy, our privacy and social peace. The bill not only limits and restricts the excessive freedom enjoyed by organizations that collect and share our data, but it also gives them responsibilities. In short, it puts the individual and the idea of consent back at the centre of reflections on digital exchanges, and that is significant.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462920"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois supports this bill because it partially fills a legal void in Canada. I say ‚Äúin Canada‚Äù because the Quebec National Assembly passed Law 25 on the protection of personal information way back in September 2021. It is a well-written law. Bill C‚Äë27 is actually largely modelled after it, and we are very proud of that.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462921"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that the protection of personal information is a shared jurisdiction, it is vital to the Bloc Qu√©b√©cois that Bill¬†C‚Äë27 not take precedence over Quebec law. This does not seem to be the case at this time, but it will be up to the committee to verify this and ensure that it does not.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462922"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking of the committee stage, many grey areas still need to be clarified. According to Daniel Therrien, a former privacy commissioner of Canada, Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> is too timid in its current form.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462923"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself have thought of something that could be studied at the committee stage, and that is image copyright. Since we are speaking about consent, the protection of anonymity, personal data and the need to adapt our legal framework to the digital era, I believe that it would be highly relevant to address this subject.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462924"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like the digital world, the world of photography has changed a great deal over the past 20 years. Thanks to smartphones, and the fact that just about everybody owns one, or even two, more and more photos are being taken. According to some estimates, more than three¬†billion photographs are taken every day around the world. An image is a form of personal information. The use and sharing of images are intrinsically linked to the principle of consent. If no consent is obtained, that is a breach of privacy. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462925"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that our current interpretation of image copyright is too strict, and this is detrimental to street photography and photojournalism. My father, Antoine Desilets, a photojournalist, was also a street photographer in his own way. Street photography is generally defined as photography done outdoors whose main subjects are people in spontaneous situations and in public places such as streets, parks, beaches and protests.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1740"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1745"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1745"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1735"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1735" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1740)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462926"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A good example of this kind of photography is the famous photograph <i>The Kiss by the H√¥tel de Ville</i>, taken by the renowned French photographer Robert Doisneau. That shot has actually been the subject of multiple lawsuits, with every Dick and Jane claiming to be one of the two main figures in the picture.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462927"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell a little story from closer to home. In 1987, a Quebec photographer and friend by the name of Gilbert Duclos took a picture of a woman in the street. After the photograph was published in a magazine, the woman decided to sue Gilbert Duclos. She claimed that she was being mocked by her friends and felt that she had been wronged.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462928"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a two-year legal saga that reached the Supreme Court, the woman won. For more than three decades, that decision, known as the Duclos decision, has been a precedent.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462929"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate was recently reignited by the case of a veiled woman and her husband who were photographed at a flea market in Sainte‚ÄëFoy. Since the photograph had been published without their consent, the photographer was forced to pay $3,500 to each of the two people in the photograph, even though the individuals were veiled. There is no doubt that the Duclos decision was used to bolster the plaintiffs' case.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462930"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, it is very easy to take a photographer to court and win. This means that many photojournalists and street photographers get sued, so unfortunately, they have to practise a form of self-censorship to protect themselves and the newspapers they work for. I believe this self-censorship has grave consequences for the arts, journalism and archive building. As it happens, on October¬†1, a group of 12 street photographers, led by the esteemed Jean Lauzon, published a book entitled <i>Le droit √† l'image</i> as a commentary on this very issue.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462931"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois believes that the committee that will study Bill¬†<a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> will have to take its time and question all the experts it needs to consult in order to come up with an ironclad law. I have a suggestion. Since we are discussing consent, privacy, the right to anonymity and personal data in the digital age, why not invite experts such as Jean Lauzon to help us understand how to modernize image copyright?</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462932"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, when does an image of an individual taken in a public space become private? Once again, there is the need for oral or written consent on the one hand, and perhaps the definition of the concept of a subject on the other. There is a whole host of factors to consider.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462933"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest, I am in favour of Bill C‚Äë27 because it gives hope that we are going to begin to plug the gaping hole that our data is currently circulating in, allowing it to be sold and exploited.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462934"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be especially important to ensure that the Quebec legislation takes precedence over the Canadian legislation, as is customary in matters of shared jurisdiction.</div></span></div>

We cannot deny the fact that the digital shift has exploded in Quebec and elsewhere over the last decade, and it has greatly changed our lifestyles.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462952"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is impressive to see which path companies have chosen during the pandemic, and I think it is a timely discussion to have today. However, I would like to draw attention to the new part of the bill that deals with artificial intelligence. I think it deserves serious consideration.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462953"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part 3 of the bill raises many questions, and opinions from experts in the field of artificial intelligence are mixed. The use of artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing field that risks expanding beyond our control and jurisdiction if we do not begin to regulate the practice and define certain concepts.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462954"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent developments in AI in general and deep learning in particular have led to the creation of autonomous intelligent agents, which are essentially robots capable of deciding what to do without third-party intervention. These agents' autonomy raises new questions about civil liability, so we have to think about criminal provisions that would apply if someone were put in a dangerous situation, for example.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462955"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should we approach this, and what legal status are we granting them? What legislative framework is the best fit for these autonomous agents?</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462956"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, we think some important definitions are missing. The law clerks who are examining the bill's provisions from a legal standpoint told us that again today. What is a high-risk intelligence system? What is a high-impact system?</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462957"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The algorithms produced in applications that use artificial intelligence enable artificial beings to create goods or services or to generate predictions or results. If we compare them to human beings and use the existing framework, how will we interpret the notions of independence and unpredictability attributable to these artificial beings? The experts will help us understand all that.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462958"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite a few goods already exist that have a layer of artificial intelligence built into them, and 90% of those goods should not pose a problem. Experts at Meta have even said that this technology has reached its limits, because the data to train an algorithm is insufficient in quantity and lacks depth.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462959"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us get back to the main problem we have with Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C‚Äë27</a>. Until the department clarifies its thinking on what constitutes a high-impact system, it will be difficult to assess the scope of part¬†3. Let us assume that everything can be considered high risk. This would mean that many companies would be accountable. If we had greater accountability, the Googles of this world might be the only ones that could risk using artificial intelligence.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462960"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does not need to cover everything a machine can do for us or everything software can do once it is developed and generates predictions and results like a calculator.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462961"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we compare it to the European legislation, we note that the latter is currently targeting employment discrimination systems, systems that would determine whether or not a permit to study there can be granted. That is essentially the limit of what the machine can do in our place.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462962"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the law in this document concerning artificial intelligence is far from being exhaustive, I believe it is important that we start somewhere. By starting here, with a framework, we can lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive law.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462963"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My speech this evening will help my colleagues better understand what needs to be clarified as soon as possible so we can have an important discussion about how to regulate the applications that use artificial intelligence and how to process these systems' data. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462964"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we will have to implement regulations for international and interprovincial exchanges for artificial intelligence systems by establishing Canada-wide requirements for the design, development and use of AI systems. Next, we must prohibit certain uses of AI that may adversely affect individuals.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1755"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1800"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1800"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1750"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1750" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1755)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462965"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is very clear on many other aspects, including on the fact that there would be a requirement to name a person responsible for artificial intelligence within organizations that use this technology. The responsibilities are fairly extensive. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462966"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the artificial intelligence and data act, which is in part 3, Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C‚Äë27</a> also includes, in part 1, the consumer privacy protection act, as well as the amendments to the former legislation. Part 2 of the bill enacts the personal information and data protection tribunal act, while part 4 includes the coming into force provisions of the bill.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462967"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleagues explained, the other sections of the bill contain a lot of useful elements, such as the creation of a tribunal and penalties. One of the acts enacted by Bill C‚Äë27 establishes a tribunal to process complaints under litigation when it comes to the use of private data. In case of non-compliance, the legislation provides for heavy penalties of up to 3% of a multinational's gross global revenue. There are provisions that are more in favour of citizens when a company misuses digital data.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462968"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, this bill does have its weaknesses. I believe those weaknesses can be addressed in committee, but they may require the introduction of new legislative measures. Public services, however, are not covered by this bill. Data in the public sector requires a greater degree of protection; this bill covers only the private sector. Take, for example, CERB fraud and the CRA. In 2020, hackers fraudulently claimed $2,000 monthly payments and altered the direct deposit information for nearly 13,000 accounts.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462969"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government can do more to tackle fraud. Unfortunately, this bill offers no relief or recourse to those whose information has already been compromised. There are digital records of nearly every important detail about our lives‚Äîfinancial, medical and education information, for example‚Äîall of which are easy targets for those who want to take advantage. It has been this way for a while, and it is only going to get worse when quantum computers arrive in the very near future.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462970"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that we must find and develop better means of online identity verification. We must have more rigorous methods, whether we are changing our requirements for passwords, for biometrics or for voice recognition.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462971"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, at the sectoral committee, we heard about how easy it is for fraudsters to call telecommunication centres and pass themselves off as someone else to access their information. We must improve identity verification methods, and we must find a way to help those who are already victims of fraud. We must do so by amending Bill¬†<a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> or introducing an additional legislative measure.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462972"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this is a fairly complex bill, it will be referred to the Standing Committee on Industry and Technology, where we will have the opportunity to hear from experts in the field. At this step, I would like to recognize the leadership of the <a id="271243" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/271243/2022-11-28">Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry</a> and his team. We have been reassured by the answers we have received.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462973"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Quebec already has data protection legislation‚ÄîBill¬†64, which became law¬†25‚Äîwe want to understand when the federal act will apply and whether the changes we requested to Bill¬†<a id="10950130" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/10950130">C-11</a>, introduced in the previous Parliament, were incorporated into this bill. I want to say that we are satisfied with the answers we have received so far.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462974"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do our due diligence because this bill includes a number of amendments. Obviously, the devil is in the details. During the technical briefings held by the department since Bill¬†C-27 was published, we asked how much time businesses would have to adjust their ways of doing things and comply with the legislation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462975"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect that there will be a significant transition period between the time when Bill¬†<a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> is passed and when it comes into force. Since the bill provides for a lot more penalties, the government will likely hold consultations and hearings to get input from stakeholders.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7462976"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would like to say that I have just come back from Tokyo, where I accompanied the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry to the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence Summit, where Quebec and France took the lead. The first summit was held in 2020. I would like to list some important values that were mentioned at this summit that deserve consideration and action: responsible development, ethics, the fight against misinformation and propaganda, trust, education, control, consent, transparency, portability, interoperability, strict enforcement and accountability. These are all values that must accompany open data and ecosystems.</div></span></div>

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11957593">Mrs. Tracy Gray (Kelowna‚ÄîLake Country, CPC)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, it is always a privilege to rise on behalf of the residents of Kelowna‚ÄîLake Country. Today we are debating Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>, an act that would enact the consumer privacy protection act, the personal information and data protection tribunal act and the artificial intelligence and data act.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463002"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians know we no longer live in the year 2000, but unfortunately much of our digital regulation still does. We have come a long way since Canadians' primary online concern was Y2K. The last time Parliament passed a digital privacy framework was PIPEDA, or the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, on April 13, 2000. The most popular website in Canada that month was AOL. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463003"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Parliament last wrote these regulations, millions of homes did not have dial-up, let alone Wi-Fi. Cellular phones lacked apps or facial recognition, and people still went continually to libraries to get information, and did not have the Alexas of the world as an alternative. They also called restaurants directly for delivery. Digital advertising amounted to flashing banners and pop-up ads. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463004"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In only 22 years, we have experienced a paradigm shift in how we treat privacy online. Personal data collection is the main engine driving the digital economy. A Facebook account is now effectively required to use certain types of websites and help those websites; a laptop can create a biometric password for one's bank account, and Canadians are more concerned about privacy than ever before.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463005"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most common videos I share with residents in my community of Kelowna‚ÄîLake Country is one relating to privacy concerns during my questioning at the industry committee in 2020, as many people reached out to me about privacy concerns. It was to a Google Canada representative regarding cellphone tracking. This was in the immediate aftermath of reports of Canadians' cellphone data being used to track people's locations during the pandemic.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463006"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cellphone tracking is something I continue to receive correspondence about, and I am sure other members in the House do as well. As traditionally defined, our right to privacy has meant limiting the information others can get about us. The privacy of one's digital life should be no different from the physical right to privacy on one's property. Canadians must have the right to access and control the collection, use, monitoring, retention and disclosure of their personal data.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463007"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy as a fundamental right is not stipulated in the legislation we are discussing today, Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>. It is mentioned in the preamble, which is the narrative at the beginning, but that is not binding. It is not in the legislation itself. While the degree to which someone wishes to use this right is ultimately up to the individual, Parliament should still seek to update the rules using detailed definitions and explicit protections. Canadians are anxious to see action on this, and I have many concerns about this legislation, which I will outline here today. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463008"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As drafted, Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> offers definitions surrounding consent rules to collect or preserve personal information. It would mandate that when personal information is collected, tech companies must protect the identity of the original user if it is used for research or commercial purposes. The legislation outlines severe penalties for those who do not comply and would provide real powers of investigation and enforcement. It presents Canada's first regulations surrounding the development of artificial intelligence systems.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463009"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> presents welcome first steps in digital information protection, there is still a long way to go if we are to secure digital rights to the standard of privacy regulation Canadians expect, and most importantly, the protection of personal privacy rights. As is mentioned in Bill C-27, digital privacy rights are in serious need of updating. However, they are not in this legislation.</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1810"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1815"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1815"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1805"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1805" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1810)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463010"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the purpose of the legislation, but many of my concerns are about inefficient, regulatory bureaucracy being created and the list of exemptions. Also, the artificial intelligence legislation included in this bill has huge gaps and should really be its own legislation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463011"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a purely operational perspective, while the legislation would empower the Privacy Commissioner's office with regard to compliance, it also constructs a parallel bureaucracy in the creation of a digital tribunal. If Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> is enacted, Canada's Privacy Commissioner can recommend that the tribunal impose a fine after finding that a company has violated our privacy laws. However, the final decision to pursue monetary penalties would ultimately rest with the new tribunal. Will this result in a duplicate investigation undertaken by the tribunal to confirm the commissioner's investigation?</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463012"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As someone who has operated a small business, I am all too aware of the delays and repetitiveness of government bureaucracy. While it is important to have an appeal function, it is evident in this legislation that the Liberals would be creating a costly, bureaucratic, regulatory merry-go-round for decisions.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463013"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians looking to see privacy offenders held accountable need to see justice done in a reasonable time frame. That is a reasonable expectation. Why not give Canada's Privacy Commissioner more authority? Of course, Canadian courts stand available. The EU, the U.K., New Zealand and Australia do not have similar tribunals to mediate their fines.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463014"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to concerns about duplications of process, I am worried that we may be leaving the definitions of offending activity too broad.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463015"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a fairly clear definition in Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>, which we are debating here today, has the consent requirement for personal data collection, there is also a lengthy list of exemptions from this requirement. Some of these exemptions are also enormously broad. For example, under exemptions for business activities, the legislation states:</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463016"></a><div>
        <div>
          <div valign="top">
            <div width="15" align="right"></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>18‚ÄÇ(1)‚ÄÇAn organization may collect or use an individual‚Äôs personal information without their knowledge or consent if the collection or use is made for the purpose of a business activity described in subsection (2) and</small></div>
</div>
</div>
</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463017"></a><div>
        <div>
          <div valign="top">
            <div width="30" align="right"></div>
<div><small>(b)‚ÄÇthe personal information is not collected or used for the purpose of influencing the individual‚Äôs behaviour or decisions.</small></div>
</div>
</div>
</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463018"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On plain reading, this exemption deals more with the field of human psychology than with business regulation.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463019"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in the legislation is this:</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463020"></a><div>
        <div>
          <div valign="top">
            <div width="15" align="right"></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(3)‚ÄÇAn organization may collect or use an individual‚Äôs personal information without their knowledge or consent if the collection or use is made for the purpose of an activity in which the organization has a legitimate interest that outweighs any potential adverse effect on the individual resulting from that collection or use</small></div>
</div>

</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463021"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an exemption to consent that would allow an organization to disclose personal information without the individual's knowledge or consent for a ‚Äúsocially beneficial purpose‚Äù. This is defined as ‚Äúa purpose related to health, the provision or improvement of public amenities or infrastructure, the protection of the environment or any other prescribed purpose.‚Äù Who determines what constitutes a socially beneficial purpose? This sounds incredibly subjective, and I have a lot of concerns when legislation is this vague.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463022"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a very simple example. Suppose a person using a coffee company app occasionally adds flavourings to their coffee while doing a mobile order. That company could recommend a new product with those flavourings already in it while a person is not physically in their business. Is this not personal information that is collected and used for the purpose of influencing an individual's decision, as in this legislation? </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463023"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This example is not hypothetical. In an investigation from actions in 2020, Tim Hortons was caught tracking the locations of consumers who had the app installed on their phones even when they were not using the company's app. Tim Hortons argued that this was for a business activity: targeted advertising. However, the report from the federal Privacy Commissioner found that the company never used it for that purpose. Instead, it was vacuuming up data for an undefined future purpose. Would Tim Hortons have been cleared if the current regulations in Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> were in place and if it had argued that the data was going to be used for future business activity or for some socially beneficial purpose, which is an exemption in the legislation?</div></span><div class="timeStamp"><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#TOC-TS-1815"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1820"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_down.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><a class="timeUp" HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1820"><span class="arrow-circle-down"></span></a><span class="time-Nav" style="display: none;"><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1810"><IMG SRC="/DocumentViewer/assets/images/publications/arrow2_up.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a></span><a HREF="http://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-136/hansard#T1810" class="timeDown"><span class="arrow-circle-up"></span></a><A class="clock">(1815)</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    </div><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463024"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I worry about the loopholes this legislation, Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a>, may create for large corporations, I am equally concerned about the potential burden it may place on start-ups as well. This legislation calls for companies to have a privacy watchdog and to maintain a public data storage code of conduct. This is vital for companies like Google, Facebook or Amazon, which have become so integral to our everyday lives and oversee our financial details and private information. Having an officer internally to advocate for the privacy of users is likely long overdue. However, while that requirement would not put much financial burden on these Fortune 500 companies, it could undermine the ability of Canadian digital innovators to get started.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463025"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has seen a boom in small-scale technology companies for everything from video game and animation studios to wellness or shopping sites for almost every good or service one could imagine. Digital privacy laws should be strong enough to not require a start-up with just a few staff to have to be mandated to have such a position internally. We should ensure that a concept of scale is appropriately applied in regulating the giants of today without crushing the future digital entrepreneurial spirit of tomorrow.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463026"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to address the presence of Canada's first artificial intelligence, or AI, regulations in this bill. While I do welcome the progress on recognizing this growing innovation need for a regulatory framework, I question whether it is a topic too large to be properly studied and included in this bill. In just the last few months, we have seen the rapid evolution of the ability of AI to create an online demand digital artwork, for example, thanks to the self-evolving abilities of machine learning. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463027"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of AI on everything from our foreign policies to agriculture production is evident. Computer scientists observed a phenomenon known as Moore's law, which showed that the processing power of a computer would exponentially double every two years, and in the 57 years since this was proposed, this law has apparently not been broken. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463028"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned that most of the rules around AI will be in regulation and not in legislation. We have seen the Liberals do this many times. They do not want to do the hard work to put policies into legislation that will be brought to Parliament and committees to be debated and voted on. They prefer to do the work behind closed doors and bring forth whatever regulations they want to impose without transparency and scrutiny. We have seen the Liberals conduct themselves many times in this way.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463029"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experts in the field have already made the case that Bill <a id="11873796" target="_blank" class="documentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/bill/11873796">C-27</a> falls seriously short of the global gold standard, the EU's 2016 General Data Protection Regulation. Canadians deserve nothing less.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463030"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though Conservatives agree with the premise of strengthening our digital privacy protection, this bill has many concerns and gaps. Clause 6 outlines that privacy protections do not apply with respect to personal information that has been anonymized. To anonymize is defined in the legislation as ‚Äúirreversibly and permanently modify personal information, in accordance with generally accepted best practices, to ensure that no individual can be identified from the information, whether directly or indirectly, by any means.‚Äù</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463031"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of risks around this. Under this legislation, information could be disclosed in numerous ways, and that is very concerning. This goes back to what I mentioned at the beginning of my speech with respect to my questioning of Google Canada early in the pandemic about tracing the locations of people through their phones and sending it to the government. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463032"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation creates more costly bureaucracy. It does not protect personal privacy as a fundamental right. It has questionable exemptions to protect the privacy of people based on ideologies. It allows the government to create large areas of regulations with no oversight or transparency and it is far from the gold standard that other countries have.</div></span></div>

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11957628">Mr. Michael Barrett (Leeds‚ÄîGrenville‚ÄîThousand Islands and Rideau Lakes, CPC)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, the last time we visited this topic, we were talking, of course, about the <a id="278921" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/278921/2022-11-28">Minister of Public Safety</a>'s claim that police had asked for him and his government to invoke the Emergencies Act.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463055"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know now that this was not true. This is pretty consistent with the government. It is part of a pattern, a pattern of disinformation and a lack of transparency.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463056"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the <a id="278921" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/278921/2022-11-28">minister</a> made that false claim, we have heard the stories of the ArriveCAN app. We have more than $54 million spent on this app, which wrongly sent thousands of Canadians into quarantine. It could have been built for many orders of magnitude less, some say hundreds of thousands of dollars, some say, at most, $1 million, certainly not $54 million.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463057"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot get the details. The Liberals will not even tell us who did the work. They will not even tell us who the subcontractors are.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463058"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we wait for the government to slowly produce invoices for us, and as parliamentarians and Canadians pore over that data, I will note one of the hard-working staff members who has been on my team for years. He is tireless in his pursuit of the truth and answers and accountability, a great Canadian, Jordan Johnston from Victoria-by-the-Sea, Prince Edward Island. Everyone back home should be really proud of the work Jordan does. He was poring through the information the government gives us in drip, drip, drips.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463059"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see a lack of transparency from the government at every opportunity. It promised in 2015 that it would be open by default, but it is anything but that, whether it is with the <a id="278921" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/278921/2022-11-28">minister</a>'s false claims on the police requesting that the government invoke the Emergencies Act, which was really just used as a way for the government to punish people it disagreed with, or with the ArriveCAN app. It does not want to tell us which Liberal insiders got these contracts. It does not want to tell us who got rich on the arrive scam.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463060"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going to keep asking the government for answers. We are going to keep demanding accountability. It looks like it is going to keep misleading Canadians and providing disinformation to throw us off the trail of whose pockets are being lined and who is getting rich on these contracts.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463061"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question to the government is very straightforward. It goes back to the promise it made in 2015. It speaks to the times we have heard the <a id="214296" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/214296/2022-11-28">Prime Minister</a> say that the story in The Globe and Mail was false, or the stories in the newspaper of late about what the Prime Minister said about having been briefed about foreign interference in our elections, when he will not tell us which 11 candidates were receiving cash from communist China. He will not tell us. He says those stories in the media are false.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463062"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals are not being straightforward with Canadians. We want transparency. Canadians deserve it. Conservatives demand it. When will the government finally be transparent with Canadians?</div></span></div>

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11957634">Mr. Mike Kelloway (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard, Lib.)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, it is good to have a chance to debate the hon. member opposite.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463064"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We want to unpack a couple of things in the member's questions in relation to what we saw last winter. This past winter we saw a state of emergency declared in Ottawa with protesters blocking key infrastructure and harassing and intimidating citizens. We also saw interference with transportation and other critical infrastructure throughout the country, which was preventing the movement of people and essential goods.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463065"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illegal blockades we witnessed were well funded and constituted a serious threat to national security. We knew through our engagement with partners that law enforcement had certain tools available to address illegal protests and blockades. Existing powers included those under provincial and municipal statutes in place to address traffic and noise violations. However, as all Canadians saw, despite those existing tools, the situation was rapidly changing and changing in a bad way. We saw it reach a point in which local law enforcement, for example here in the nation's capital of Ottawa, required additional assistance to address the unique situation posed by the illegal blockades.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463066"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also saw that the economy as a whole was being affected by the situation, with the safety and security of Canadians in more than one province affected. We knew the decision to invoke the Emergencies Act was becoming clearer. Invoking the act was a measure, and the <a id="214296" target="_blank" class="MemberOfParliamentPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/aff/214296/2022-11-28">Prime Minister</a> and others have spoken to this, of last resort, which is the situation we found ourselves in.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463067"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The new measures the act provided were additional to the existing tools, and they were squarely aimed at public safety and protecting our country's interests. The new measures were temporary and in place to address a specific emergency. They helped to prohibit unlawful assembly that interrupted the movement of people and goods, affected trade or interfered with critical infrastructure.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463068"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also helped to deter the financing of the occupation and end material protests to the illegal demonstrations. They helped to secure our border crossings, bridges, airports and other public institutions. As well, thanks to the temporary measures available under the act, we saw vehicles towed, including, most vividly, here in Ottawa, where Wellington Street and the streets of the downtown core were finally given back to the public of Ottawa. We saw the act being used to bring about the peaceful conclusion of the illegal blockades at ports of entry, at the border, deterring unlawful actions and encouraging, in fact, peaceful protest.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463069"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February 14, we invoked the act, at the right time, for the right reasons, in the right way. We revoked it at the right time, for the right reasons, in the most responsible way.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463070"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we find ourselves looking back, able to take a necessary look at what was done and what could be done, quite frankly, differently. Along with the significant limits and safeguards that provided, we knew that accountability mechanisms were also built into the very act. That includes the Special Joint Committee on the Declaration of Emergency scrutiny and the invocation of the act. It includes the work of the Public Order Emergency Commission, which is examining the aspects of the public order emergency and the Emergencies Act.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463071"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the accountability Canadians demand. It is exactly what they will get thanks to our responsible, timely and effective use of the Emergencies Act, just as the act intended.</div></span></div>

        <div class="personSpeaking"><b><a target="_blank" class="PersonSpeakingPopup" href="//apps.ourcommons.ca/ParlDataWidgets/en/intervention/11957648">Ms. Elizabeth May (Saanich‚ÄîGulf Islands, GP)</a>: </b>&nbsp;</div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, it is my honour to rise to take up a point that I debated in this place when we first had the news from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in the spring of this year, that we have less time than we thought in responding to the urgency of the science. The panel reported that, if we did not reduce our emissions rapidly, we would lose any chance of holding to 1.5¬∫C global average temperature increase, and that we had to stay below 2¬∫C. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463078"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point, in my question to the government members, I quoted the United Nations Secretary General, Ant√≥nio Guterres. He, when speaking recently of the promises made in Paris at COP21 in 2015 versus the delivery on climate action by governments around the world, said that some governments are promising to reduce emissions, but emissions are increasing. He said, ‚ÄúSimply put, they are lying.‚Äù I asked the hon. government members, when the UN Secretary General was speaking of governments that were doing one thing and saying another, whom did our government think Ant√≥nio Guterres was referencing.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463079"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the time of my question, it has been clear that the government has provided additional support to the expansion of fossil fuel development. Now we have a very clear difference here, and I want to set out the problem because I want to be fair to all concerned. The government of the current Liberal minority, supported by the NDP in their confidence-supply agreement, appears to believe, or at least wants Canadians to believe, that reaching net zero by 2050 is a target that will ensure we can hold our increase in global average temperature to 1.5¬∫C, or at least as far below 2¬∫C as possible.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463080"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals put forward this notion, and they emphasized it again in the climate accountability act that was passed in the last Parliament, even though it is not true. It is not true that achieving net zero by 2050 assures us of a livable world. In fact, the science in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth assessment report makes it very clear that the 2050 target of net zero is irrelevant if emissions continue to rise in the near term. In other words, again from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a 2050 target without emissions must peak globally and begin to fall dramatically at the latest before 2025 or any hope of 1.5¬∫C or 2¬∫C is gone. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463081"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 2¬∫C world is unthinkable, yet we are on track to it. Again quoting Ant√≥nio Guterres of the United Nations, when COP27 opened earlier this month in Sharm el-Sheikh, he said that the world is ‚Äúon a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.‚Äù</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463082"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, again, what government does the Canadian government believe the UN is referencing when it says that some governments are promising and doing the opposite? He said, ‚ÄúSimply put, they are lying.‚Äù As well, to whom does the government think it is referring to when it says ‚Äúfoot on the accelerator‚Äù, when we have a government that is insisting on building pipelines, expanding production and drilling off Newfoundland? Whom is the United Nations referencing?</div></span></div>

However, what appears to be underlying his statement is a deep concern with the state of global emissions despite several decades of international co-operation and political commitments. I share this deep concern and so does our government. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463085"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With less than a decade left to 2030, and with countries around the world quickly moving to a cleaner economy, Canada's 2030 target of 40% to 45% below 2005 levels is ambitious, necessary and achievable, reflecting both the scale of the climate crisis and the economic opportunity that climate action presents. This target reflects Canada's highest possible ambition in light of its current national circumstances.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463086"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's 2030 emissions reduction plan is a road map that goes sector by sector, outlines the measures and strategies for Canada to reach this target and lays the foundations for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This plan includes $9.1 billion in new investments and a suite of new measures to help mobilize Canada towards a truly sustainable economy and becoming a leading competitor in the global transition to cleaner industries and technologies. This plan also builds on the strong foundation set by the pan-Canadian framework on clean growth and climate change and the strengthened climate plan. As well, since 2015, the government has delivered $100 billion in investments for climate action. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463087"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These efforts are working. Thanks to the actions of millions of Canadians, we have been able to halt our once-upward trend of emissions and bend it downward. This road map will build on this progress and chart the course to lowering emissions by 40% below 2005 levels. </div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463088"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, ambitious action by Canada alone is not enough. Climate change is a global crisis that requires global solutions. Under the Paris Agreement, all have adopted national emissions targets. Like Canada, many have recently come forward with even stronger commitments. Still, there is much more to be done at the global level, and Canada will continue to play a key role and strongly advocate that all countries, particularly members of the G20, do their part to achieve the 1.5¬∞C temperature goal.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463089"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We need more countries to adopt stronger targets and formal commitments to achieve net-zero emissions. We need to see greater public and private investment in low-carbon solutions. We need to see an even more deliberate and rapid move away from unabated coal. As we move forward in driving down Canada's own emissions, we will continue to engage with international partners from all over the world and advocate for increased ambition.</div></span></div>

It was an honour. Chiefs shared the many ways that first nations and wild salmon are interconnected, not only regarding food security but regarding social, ceremonial and first nations' inherent and constitutionally protected rights to harvest fish and provide for their communities. In fact, 90% of B.C. first nations rely on wild salmon. Despite this, we are seeing historic low returns.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463098"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vital wild salmon are facing many threats, such as the impacts of climate crises, including extreme weather, flooding, heat domes, forest fires and warming waters, and all of this while we are continuing to allow fish farms in our coastal waters to damage our marine ecosystems. We see salmon left to swim through diseases and sea lice found in key migratory routes, which is all spewing from polluting fish farms that are being allowed to maintain and continue business by the government.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463099"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We heard from first nations chiefs in this meeting, who spoke to the diseases being carried by fish exposed to the impacts of fish farms. They were being described as glowing and covered in sores and sea lice, which has never been seen before. There are endless examples of impacts, and first nations chiefs across British Columbia described to us impacts on both wild salmon and their coastal communities.</div></span><span class="paratext"><a name="Para7463100"></a><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am wondering if my colleague can provide us with action and the reassurance today that we are going to move away from open-net fish farms and finally follow through with a plan to get them out.</div></span></div>
