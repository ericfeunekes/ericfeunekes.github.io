# Can I work on open source projects at my job?

This is a question that I was wondering about recently. There are many aspects to consider: 

1. What would my employer think about me contributing to projects where they don't own the intellectual property?
2. Does the project count as "work" or is it just a hobby?
3. Who owns the intellectual property of the code I write?

In this post I'm going to ignore the moral/ethical/personal questions (i.e. the first two) and focus on the legal questions (i.e. the third). Here are my assumptions:

1. I'm a software developer working for a company that owns the intellectual property of the software that I write.
2. I'm contributing to an open source project that I don't own the intellectual property of, that has a permissive open source licence (e.g. MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0, etc).
3. I'm contributing to the project during my work hours, on a work computer, using work resources.
4. I'm not being paid to contribute to the project.

## Starting with the basics

### What is copyright?

"Copyright" is defined in several places in the [Copyright Act](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-42/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-42.html?autocompleteStr=copy&autocompletePos=1) (the "Act"), but for the purpose of this post I'll use the following simplified definition: Copyright is the right to copy and distribute a work.
