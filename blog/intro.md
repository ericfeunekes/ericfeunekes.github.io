# Some posts by a coder who lawyers

This is a blog about programming, law, and other things. It's a place for me to write about things I'm interested in, and to share my thoughts on the things I'm learning. Fair disclosure, I've probably used some form of AI to help me write these posts, so are the posts truly mine? Maybe a topic for another post.

Here's some posts I've written:

## Typical disclaimer about legal advice, etc.

This blog is a hobby. To the extent that I've written about something related to law, I'm not giving legal advice, I'm just answering questions that I'm curious about because [teaching others is the best way to learn](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/). I'm not your lawyer. If you need legal advice, please consult a lawyer.
